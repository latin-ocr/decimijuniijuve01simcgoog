dius had studied quo firmior adversus sortutissa rempubltkoem
capesseret (Hist. xv. 5). But it is certain from more than one
f passage that he had succeeded in arranging his own life without
the support of convictions though not without the stimulus os
ideas. As these ideas were mostly borrowed from the Porch,
it would be possible for a careless reader to class him among
the disciples of Zeno. It would be hard to make* the same
mistake about Juvenal: there is indeed one satire, the fifteenth‚
where he appeals to Stoicism with as much respect as a satirist
can appeal to any authority 3 there are otherS, like the fourth
and tenth, where he uses Stoical ideas without anything ape

who was not heartily in eamest about his own character, a
subject which seldom interests a satirist.

Another point in which Juvenal and Tacitus in the main
coincide is their indignation against the delatores‚· a pest which
has had its analogues under every tyranny. At Rmne it
assumed a peculiar form owing to several circumstances, of
which the most important were the hypocrisy of the Caesars in
’ retaining the forms of a republic and the absence of any system
of state police. The tyranny of a bad emperor was irresistible‚
but it was far from being omnipresent: the govemment of the
senate and the equesuian order had proved itself inadequate to
