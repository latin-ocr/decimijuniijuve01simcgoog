xliv INTRODUcTrON.

In the Eighth‚ most MSS., but not the best, omit ν’. 7 (see
note): v. 78 might be omitted as a question of taste‚ on the
same principle as all editors omit Gutta cavat lapidem, con·
sumitur anulus usu, which occurs in the Dresden MS, after
xm. 18: vv. 111, 112, are in all the MSS. 3 but they are so flat
that Jahn and Manso wish to leave them out altogether, while
Heinrich and Heinecke more plausibly treat unicus as a gloss
on unus, and go straight on to Despicias tu. Jahn and Lach-
mann condemn ν. 1243 Ruperti, v. 194, and is followed by
Heinrich in his condemnation of v. 202.

In the T enth, Ruperti condemns v. 37, Pinzger v. 1483
Heinrich condemns v. 189, but not v. 187.

In the Eleventh, at v. 30, Heinecke wishes to read vel sacri
in parte senatus Esse velih, seu tu magno discrimine causam
Protegere affectas, (ἕνα, striking out two lineS, which are a
⁴tasteless display of cheap reading. Heinrich condemns vv. 63

and 99, in which last he is followed by Jahn: v. 108 is omitted ·

by Heinrich and several MSS., and condemned by jahn: vv.
165, 166, are also omitted by several MSS., and condemned,
perhaps justly, by Heinrich, Pinzger and Jahn: as the Scholium
in several MSS., which gives thern, “ Hi duo versus et in aliis
raperti sunt,’' makes it not improbable that they are a marginal
quotation, which different copyists foisted into the text at
different places, Heinrich condemns v. 182, but not v. 208.

In the Twelfth, v. 36 is condemned by Heinrich, vv. 51, 52,
by Bentley, Pinzger, Heinrich, Jahn.

In the Thirteenth, Heinrich is alone in condemning v. 166.

In the Fourteenth, v. 229 interrupts the grammatieal se
quence, is omitted in six MSS., and condemned by Ruperti,
Heinrich, Jahn; but it seems more likely that Juvenal left it,

· than that an interpolator introduced it.

In the Fisteenth‚ Ruperti condemns v. 34. Francke, who
wants to show that he wishes disinterestedly to purify Juvenal’s

text as well as to prove that he was never in Egypt, omits from
summus utrimque in v. 35, to sed in v. 38, as well as the
longer passage from horrida sane in v. 44, to titubantibus in
