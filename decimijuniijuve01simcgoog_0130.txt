78. D. JUNII JUVENALIS

More Numae caedit J ovis ante altaria, jurat
Solam Eponam et facies olida ad praesepia pictas.
Sed quum pervigiles placet instaurare popinas,
Obvius assiduo Syrophoenix udus· amomo

- Currit, Idumaeae Syrophoenix incola portae,

Hospitis affectu dominum regemque salutat,
Et cum venali Cyane succincta lagena.
Defensor culpae dicet mihi, “ Fecimus et nos

Haec juveneS.”

Esto. Desisti nempe, nec ultra
F ovisti errorem. Breve sit, quod turpiter audes3

from Thermae (inf. 168); but they
would not be called after the great
Thermae, more likely Thermarum
:Thermopoliorum

160 mumanae —- portae] Some
suppose a pass in Phoenicia: so
‘⁶ Albana porta” (val. Flacc. iii.
497); others the arch of Titus.

162 sucmncta] “ Ready both to
wait and dance.’'

163, 164] “I may be told we
did the same too when we were
young. Be it so; you have given
it up now, you mean to say.” So
Mayor. »

167 lateranus] A noble, who
perished in the conspiracy of Piso,
bore this name: he had had an
inti-igue with Messalina.

168 Thermarum] It would be
luxurious‚ but not low, to drink at
the baths; hence lintea is not likely
to mean ‘toweL' Cf. sup. 158 n.—

a'nd he goes up to profit by it.
Orelli, Corpus Inscript. N. 4329,
gives one of these advertisements
from Lyons. Mercurius hic lucrum
promittit Apollo salutem: Septuma·
nus hospitium cum prandio. Qui
venerit melius utetur. Post, hos·
pesubimaneas,prospice. This tavern
offered sacilities for play, kept an
iatralipta. 'After arriving there the
traveller could spend the evening,
and sleep (for one night only) and
get his breakfast before looking out
sor ermanent quarters. According
to t e second view, instead of eating
his dinner like a gentleman with a
clean napkin of his own, or his host's,
Lateranus uses napkins out of a
greasy capsa, marked with the eat·
ing-house mark to prevent them
from being stolen by discreditable
customerS.
169 Armemu syriaeque] The
scene of Corbulo's campaigns.
