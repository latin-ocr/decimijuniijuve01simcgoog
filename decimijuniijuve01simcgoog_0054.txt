2 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Scriptus et in terg0‚ nec dum finituS, Orestes?
Nota magis nulli domus est sua, quam mihi lucus
Martis et Aeoliis vicinum rupibus antrum

Vulcani.

Quid agant venti, quas torqueat umbras

AeacuS, unde alius furtivae devehat aurum · 10
Pelliculae‚ quantas jaculetur Monychus ornOS,

Frontonis platani convulsaque marmora clamant

Semper, et assiduo ruptae lectore columnae.

Exspectes eadem a summo minimoque poeta.

Et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximuS, et nos 1 5
Consilium dedimus Sullae, privatus ut altum

has not done yet: et, even when
out of its usual place, generally
goes with the word which comes
after it. .

7 lucus Martis] “In quo Ilia
peperit.'' Schol.‚ would occur in a
poem on Romulus: the rest, as far
as Aeacus, suggests a ‘ rifacimento’
of the Odyssey. Alius must be
taken as indicating a transition to
another legendary cycle‚ otherwise
we might place the grove in Colchos,
according to another guess of the
Scholiast, and refer the rocks of
Aeolus, in the modern Stromboli,
and cave of Vulcan, in the modern
Vulcano, to the Argonautic legend,
on th6e >authority of Ap. Rhodius
(iv. 1 .

11⁷ quantas] The poetasters re-
fine upon ovid: “insani dejectam
viribus Austri Forte trabem nactuS.''
Monychus = MononychuS, a cen-
taur. “

12 frontonis] Pliny (Ep. ii. ιι,
ἓ 3) praises the oratory of one
Fronto Catius, who may have be·
3¹1¹? ἳξῖῖῗ ἑῗ 132 fisszfikffstffss‘iztzz·
Maecenatiani‚ on the strength of
which he claimed connexion with
Horace.

marmora] Mayor seems to take
this of marble panels round the
walls, shaken by the shouts of the
audience, which is hardly consistent

with platani ,· Macleane, of the mar·
ble pillars‚ which makes columnae
tautological. One is tempted to
think of marble statueS, cf. xiii. 115:
as if the poet's friends told him
his stirring verse was enough to
make stones cry out, while Juvenal
iigffiffge ῒξὲῑξίἔξῖαξῖξὲῖέὴῐῗὲ 5111ιέἰὶῗὲ

them on their pedestals.

1 3 assiduo ruptae lectore] Mayor
follows Hand in thinking that the
omission of ab marks the absence
of' voluntat-y agency. Hand admits
that the omission only occurs in the
{1⁰32 ἷῖἀεῗᾷῗζίξὲἓῗ Ἓὲῗὲὲὲἓὲῗ
venience, or a passign sor brevity.
Here we might explain the words as
an ablative absolute, because there
is a reader always leaning against
them, because readers give them no
rest; cf. viii. 137, hebetes lasso lic-
tore secures.

15 ergo] This is to be taken in
connection with the preceding line.
All poets treat the same subjects3
well, I am qualified to treat them

t00, inf. 19 tamen serves to contrast
hoc with eadem.

16 dedimus] “We have given,'’
is a present qualification for writing.
Dormiret, the result contemplated,
is naturally in the past, as the advice
must have been decided on long
ago. Cf. vii. 1613 x. 167. Boys
