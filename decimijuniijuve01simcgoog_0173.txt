52] They throw away [not only
Catullus' pretty things, but] the
greater part of the stores and tack-
ling. Νεεεοὺδέ. There is little dif-
ference between “ this had no effect
either ζ’ and “even this had no
effect!

54 Reccidit] Most MSS.›through
a.weak sear of a false quantity give
Desilit. Cf. ‘⁴ Reccidit ·in solidam
longo post tempore terram.¹' Ov-
Met. x. 180. The nominative of
course is rector, a strong confirmation
of the suspicion expressed ·in the

poffiogeizefughd so releases himself

from his sti-ait, lit. his straitened
sels. One MS. reads hac re, ‘ by
this expedient he clears the strait,’
which is a curious nse of ang-ustum,⁸

hac se might be a genuine reading,
altered in opposite directions.

MSS. read, and P. most likely read
lautissima, as if it were a fine thing
to have the inflammable timber thick
enoughto keep nlight.

62—4] One 'looks in vain for a
finite verb between tempora and pe·
lagv. As it would be a violence to the
run of Latin to make prospera and
valentius predicates instead of epi-
thets‚ we have to choose between
supposing that Juvenal intended to
supply at least one verb to which

satum and tempora could be nomi·

nativeS, and supplying two oui-selves
to suit our taste irom. the context. .
