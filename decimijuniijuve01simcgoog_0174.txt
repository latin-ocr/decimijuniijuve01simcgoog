nobody ever saw3’ ’his translators
are restricted to the first and worst.

76 rursum] Ma y‚or “stretched
out and bending backst’ ‚ perhaps lt is
sufficiently emphatic to be separated
from porrec brachia, and car-

Pharon, the marvels os t are
reproduced in Italy. ·

79 Quot natura dedit] Does this
mean that they are surpassed; that
at Alexandria the isle of Pharos was
ready to hand. ⁹
