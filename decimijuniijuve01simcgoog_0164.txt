ιη. D. JUN11 · JUVENALIS

Ad quod lascivi ludebant ruris alumni.

Tales ergo cibi, qualis domus atque supellex.
Tunc rudis et Graias mirari nescius artes
Urbibus eversiS, praedarum in parte reperta
Magnorum artificum frangebat pocula mileS‚

Ut ‘phaleris gauderet equuS, caelataque cassis
Romuleae simulacra ferae mansuescere jussae
Imperii fato, geminos sub rupe Quirinos‚=

Ac nudam effigiem clypeo venientis et hasta
Pendentisque Dei, perituro ostenderet hosti.
Argenti quod erat, solis fulgebat in armis:
Ponebant igitur Tusco farrata catino;

‘Omnia tunc quibus invideas, si lividulus sis,
Templorum quoque majestas praesentior, et vox
Nocte fere media, mediamque audita per urbem,
Litore ab Oceani Gallis venientibus et Dis,
Officium vatis peragentibuS‚ his monuit nos,

resentations of Mars hanging over

pendentis better than to think of
him as fighting, though even as a
lover he looks terrible to the falling

Greek fashion without the breast·
plate or the kilt which completed it.

ate, shew their taste by omitting
this line, though it makes ‘igitur'
come in more naturally.

109] Is a more pointed repetition
of 99: one suspects that the author
wrote them as alternatives‚ and then
he or an editor unwilling to sacrifice
either found a place for both. Tusco
catino is just the opposite of gulosum
