Radat inaurati femur Herculis· et faciem ipsam

An dubitet, solitus toturn conflare Tonantem i·
Confer et artifices mercatoremque veneni ,

Et deducendum -corio bovis in mare, cum quo

Clauditur adversis innoxia· simia fatis,

Haec quota pars scelerum, quae Custos Gallicus urbis
Usque a Lucifero, donec lux occidat, audit ?

Humani - generis mores tibi· nosse ⁴volenti ·

Sufficit una domus. Paucos consume dies, et

Dicere te miserum, postquam illinc veneriS, aude.
Quis tumidum guttur miratur in Alpibus ? aut quis
In Meroe crasso majorem infante mamillam?
Caerula quis stupuit Germani lumina, flavam

Caesar-iem et madido torquentem cornua cirro Ρ

165

Nempe quod haec illis natura est omnibus una.

cal offerings to be carried off whole,
lesser thieves start up to serape the
thigh of Hercules, or even the face
of Neptune, which they can do
without blazoning their guilt; hence
minor, for they would melt down
'whole statues, if there were any
lest. —Solitus is very puzzling: how
can a man in the habit of melting
down Juppiter be a minor sacrilegus?
Gifl'ord accuses Juvenal of negli-

ce, Macleane suspects the text.
{ecthaps we are to think of an under-
ling in N ero's wholesale perqui-
sitions, who had helped
plunder, and when that employment
came to an end went into the same
business in a small way on his own
account.— Constare, almost by way
οἰ retaliation, melt down the thun-
derer, as the thunderbolt, which sin-
ners generally sear, melts the hills.

cence.

· 157 amicus} A gentle praefec-

to melt his

tus urbis under Domitian.. It is
difficult to make this agree with amy
F onteiuS, as the first would place
the satire soon aster 72 A.D.: and
Gallicus can hardly have been in
office then.

160 una] That of Gallicus.

165 madido cuno] The reeking
topknot into which the stiffened
curly locks were twisted after being
moistened with the soap used as a dyc.

166] So sar the connection with
the subject is obvious ; it is as ab·
surd to be surprised at wickednes:
in Rome as at any other local pecu-
liarity, but the next illustration con-
fuses the sense. Calvinus does not
think‘ his loss a laughing matter3
what is gained by telling him that
the pygmies do not dream of
laughing at their military misadven-
tures ? We need not answer the
question if we suppose that vv. 162
—173 were written without refer-
ence to Calvinus and shoved in from
Juvenal’s commonplace book. ·
