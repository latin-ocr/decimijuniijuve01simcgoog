suggestion of an actor, especiallyssiwhen the actor’s influence
had been removed3 nor would his resentment be lessened if
'Juvenal had deliberately republished, with an application to
his own reign, what had been originally directed against the
earlier PariS, the favourite of Nero. A wider question suggests
itself here. Did Juvenal begin to write under Nem, and to
publish under Domitian, while the revised edition of his works
was interrupted by death, perhaps in Trajan’s' reign Ρ

of Appendix. 1f Juvenal was in the habit of retouching his
compositionS, it is obviously unsafe to infer the date of a satire
from single lines 3· for in such a laboured style innumerable
additions and insertions would be possible, which would im-
prove the brilliancy of the general effect, without impairing its
unity. Hence we cannot build much upon the following list
of passages. ·

In' 1. 47, vm. 120, Juvenal mentions ¹the exile and rapacity
of Marius Priscus, who was condemned for oppression in pro7
consular Africa, A.1>. 100, which is the latest date that we can
fix with certainty..
