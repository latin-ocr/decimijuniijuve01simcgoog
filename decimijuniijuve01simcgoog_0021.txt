individual members was the end, and the prosperity oi the
empire the means. After all there is little reason for surprise
that the antagonisms which produced the empire should. have
liwed on under it. The power of the emperors tested upon
opinion no less ‚than upon force3 or rather, the convictions ’
and interests of the military force of the State made it necessary
‘that there should be an emperor. Among other causes, public

not only to introduce new principles of government, but tq
raise a new class to power to carry out those principles· The
principles triumphed with the first Caesar 3 all the Caesars con1
