DYQWAEJ Tectorum assiduos ac mille pericula saevae
Urbis, et Augusto recitantes mense poetas?
Sed dum tota domus ἐμά-ξ componitur una,

2 vacuis] Empty, as appears from
unum civem donare Sibyllae,- but we
have “ Sed vacuum Tibur placet
aut imbelle Tarentum ” (Hor. Ep. i.
7, 45), where it means leisurely2—
gquieta Cyme’' (Stat. Silv. iv. 3.

5)4 :Ianua Baiarum est] So called
as the point to which Domitian
carried his new branch of the Via
Appia, to meet the local roads of
the district of· Baiae.

5 Ego vel Prochytam praepono
Suburae] Juvenal names Prochyta,
a bare volcanic island then unculti-
vatcd‚ as the most unattractive place
in the neighbourhood of Cumae,
and the Subura as the part of Rome
where a poor Roman would natu-
rally have to live. Cf. xi. 51 τ “Es-
quilias a ferventi migrare Subura.'’

6 miserum] Im liesthe absence
civilisation, so-
lum the absence of the pleasure of
society.

9 Augusto recitantes mense poe·
tas] They are dangerqu3‚ as they

make you hear them in crowded
rooms, in the hottest part of the

holidays, when you have no excuse ⁴

for refusing, if in town.

10 componitur] We should say,
“ While the household was being
packed up ’'—speaking from the
point of time at which we are: the
Romans say, “ While it is being
packed up’' from the point at which
the subject of the principal verb was.

Cf. xiv. 94, 95:

“Totam hanc turbavit filius
amem,
Dum meliore novas attollit
marmore villa5.'’

In general, however, a continuous
process, or state contemporary with
a single determinate fact, seems to
be in the present3 while if . the con-
temporary event be equally con·
tinuous, it attracts the clause witb
dum into the past tense 3 SO, ‘⁴ Dum
Sulla in aliis rebus erat occupatum,
erant qui suis vulneribus mede-
rentur” (Cic. Ii'osc. Am. 32).
