90 autem] seems to refer to 77,
78. If so, Curius—legvnem is an
overgrown parenthesis3 and the

‚connexion will be: “This was the

way our senate supped when luxury
was coming in (to be sure, Curius
lived on pot-herbs, with bacon for
a treat on birthdays, and his dis-
tinguished friends were glad to joiri
him). On the other hand, when
a Fabius, a Scaurus, and the rest
were left to keep the world in awe,
no one thought seriously of tortoise·

shell couches.'’
— Fabios] The Scholiast has a

'story that Q. Fabius Maximus when

censor told P. Decius his coll e

,either to reform the state himsel or

leave him to do so. The story is

2hardly invented from this passage

and is quite in the'style of the lovers’
quarrels in Livy x. 24, though he
with finer artistic sense keeps them

·f0r the close of their career. It is

even possible that Juvenal may have

,been thinking of it, and the plural
.(a Fabius) is no objection.

91 Scaurus] refers to M. Aemi·

flius, consul B.C.=1 15 (when he passed

a sumptuary law against eating dor-
mice), censor ΒΕ. 109. His dili·
gence, tact‚ and decorum, gave him
immense influence in his life, and
his posthumous reputation was· the
higher, because he was the last
statesman who proved capable of
administering affairs in the interest
of the nobility.

Oceanum mare is frequent. '

96] The meaning is, “ Lectus

arvus nudo latere et fronte aerea 3 ”
but the sentence is so turned, as to
throw aerea into the nom„ and
bring out the contrast with testudo.
Nudo latere means not without a
side -rail‚ but the side plain. Frons
aerea is the head, which had a cheap
design of satyrs playing round an
ass's head, unless we are to under-
stand country children playing about
the feasters like sat τε.
