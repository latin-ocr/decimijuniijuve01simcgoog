SATIRA VII.

Dum petit aut thermas aut Phoebi balnea, dicat
Nutricem Anchisae, nomen patriamque novercae

,Archemori3 dicat, quot Acestes vixerit annOS,

Quot Siculus Phrygibus vini donaverit urnas,
Exigite, ut mores teneros ceu pollice ducat,
Ut si quis cera vultum facit3 exigite, ut· sit

Et pater ipsius coetuS, ne turpia ludant,
Ne saciant vicibus· ‘⁴ Non est leve tot puerorum '

Accipe, victori populus quod postulat, aurum.’'

went deeper and became, Who was
the mother of AEneas in the sense

Aen. x. 388, 389 that Archemorus
or Anchemolus had a stepmother
the wife of Rhoetus, and that he
fought under Turnus, Servius adds
that the-stepmother was Casperia a
Greek, and that Archemorus was
received by Daunus the father of

Turnus. We leam, Aen. v. 73, that
Acestes was old, ib. i. 195, that he

gave the Trojans wine. The ques· “

casks he gave, follow of course.
Tiberius had a great taste for annoy-

questions, and of course there was
another set to solve· them.
