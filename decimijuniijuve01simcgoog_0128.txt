D. JUN11 -JUVENALIS

Auri atque argenti, scutum gladiumque relinquas ι
Et jacula et galeam, spoliatis arma supersunt.

Quod modo proposui, non est sententia: verum

125

Credite me vobis folium recitare Sibyllae.

Si tibi sancta cohors comitum, si nemo tribunal
Vendit Acerse'comes, si nullum in conjuge crimen,
N ec per conventus et cuncta per oppida curvis

Unguibus ire parat nummos raptura Celaeno:

130

Tunc licet a Pico numeres genus, altaque si te
Nomina delectant, omnem Titanida pugnam
Inter majores ipsumque Promethea ponas:

De quocunque voles proavum tibi sumito libro.

Quod si praecipitem rapit ambitio atque libido,

135

Si frangis virgas sociorum in sanguine, si te
Delectant hebetes lasso lictore secures:

what knowledge they wanted from
the evidence. What they liked was
to have a series of plausible pre-
sumptious laid before them on which
they could make up their minds. Ι

‘ve the Scholiast's reading, which,
gom its difficulty, has disappeared
from all but one MS. of the ninth
century. P. and several others have
relin uetes, the maj0rity relinques,
whic gives an opportunity to who·
ever likes to improve Juvenal by
omitting 124. Ι suspect P. origin·
ally had tollat with injuria as nom..
as the corrector had to erase a letter
to make room sor s. Of course, if
s0, 124 must be as old as both P.'s
variants·

126 rollum] It seems that the
-Sibylline books consisted of packets
os loose leaves, and that the way of

at random from the packet, and in·

max. She is not content with the
pickings she can make in the few
towns in which her husband holds
courts and transacts business ς she
goes the rounds of all.

131 a Pico] A pedigree ending
in Picus might be a genuine tradi·
tion ; one that included all the Titans,
and all the first generation of Olym-
piam, must be a concession to vanity.
