are directed at least as much against the heartlessness' and the
ruffianly insolence of the great as against the defective police of
Rome or the snobbish appetites of the diner out, or against the
smooth servility of foreignerS. We seem to trace in Juvenal
vestiges of another grievance which affiicted Romanos rerum
dominos gentemque togatam as soon as Claudius and Nero had
decided that the empire should be cosmopolitan. Not only did
it become possible for foreigners to succeed almost as ‘well as
natives where success depended upon merit, to succeed better
where success depended upon favour ; but as there are pas-
sages in Horace which suggest without proving that the Romans
were beginning to carry on an active trade between the Levant
and Rome, so there are passages in Juvenal which suggest that
this trade was passing back into the hands of the LevantineS.

Of course the indictment of the ‘have nots’ against the
‘ haves' never varies much in its nature‚· and is always only too
well supported by facts. The class of which Juvenal chose to
be the organ is always bitter against men of assured position ;
but the organ of their bitterness is generally without an ech03
the expression of their discontent is generally stifled by the
certainty that it will be met by the conspiracy of silence3 it
could not be stifled in Rome, and, to that extent, we are war·
ranted in concluding that Rome was worse than London.

As Juvenal's class was proud of its nationality it had natur-
ally no sympathy with the cosmopolitan philosophy of Stoicism3
in this Juvenal resembles Tacitus: the grievance of the satirist
was that his order could not profit by the world, the grievance
of the historiari was that his order could not govern the world:
neither of them was inclined to accept the doctrine ‘that the
world was not made for individuals or for classeS‚ but that these
were produced by the order of the world and for the order of
the world. Yet both Tacitus and Juvenal owe much to Stoi-
cism: the taste for sonorous morality was sufficiently strong in
-both to make them eager to avail themselves of as much of its
conclusions as could be separated from its premisses. To
Tacitus Stoicism commended itself as the system which Helvia
