D. JUN11· JUVENALis

Ad subitas Thracum volucres nubemque sonoram
Pygmaeus parvis currit bellator in armis:
Mox impar hosti raptusque per aera curvis

Unguibus a saeva fertur grue. Si videas hoc

Gentibus in nostris, risu quatiare: sed illic,

Quanquam eadem assidue spectentur proelia, ridet

Nemo, ubi tota cohors pede non est altior uno, · ⁸
“ Nullane perjuri capitis fraudisque nefandae

Poena erit? ’' Abreptum crede hunc graviore catena

ProtinuS‚ et nostro (quid plus velit ira?) necari
Arbitrio: manet illa tamen jactura, nec unquam
Depositum tibi sospes erit: sed corpore trunco
Invidiosa dabit minimus solatia sanguis:

“At vindicta bonum vita jucundius ipsa.”

Nempe hoc indocti, quorum praecordia nullis
Interdum aut levibus videas flagrantia causis,
Quantulacunque adeo est occasi0‚ sufficit irae:
Chrysippus non dicet idem nec mite Thaletis

Ingenium dulcique senex vicinus Hymett0,

for the poet ·of the pygmies‚ is the
rgverse os that which is natural for

is sport to us is death to them.

money back; and when you behead

on the sufficiency of a little common
sense to subdue excessive irritation
at a trifling loss, Juvenal here *falls
back on an appeal to philosophy;
the subJect is not congenial‚ and
after a dozen lines on the folly os
desii-ing vengeance, we have more
than fifty on the certainty that in
some form or other Calvinus will
have his revenge-
