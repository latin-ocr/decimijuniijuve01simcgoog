74 n. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quum Pansa eripiat, quidquid tibi Natta reliquit,
Jamque tace: furor est post omnia perdere naulum.
'Non idem gemitus olim, neque vulnus erat par ‘
Damnorum‚ sociis florentibus et modo victis,

Plena domus tunc omniS, et ingens stabat acervus

Nummorum, Spartana chlamyS, conchylia Coa,
Et cum Parrhasii tabulis signisque Myronis
Phidiacum vivebat ebur3 nec non Polycleti
Multus ubique labor; rarae sine Mentore mensae.

raggd 955* Caeslar AJVZrtizan ssmgffi
cognomen of an obscure family of
the gens Pinaria. Juvenal would
know it from the snob in Horace.
Probably, “When the noble go-
vernor robs you of what the plebeian
lest, relieve yourself by putting
up your rags to auction, to get the
money sor a voyage to Rome. When
you've got, it, don't be such a foo'l
as g0.’' Ι give the MS. order: some
ed. transpose 95, 96. The Scholiast
think's the object of the sale is
simply to live on the proceeds.

101 spartana] For thedye.—Coa
, for the material. The discovery of
unravelling silk stuffs and weaving
them up more loosely, was made in
CeoS, according to Pliny, who adds,
that there are silk.worms ¹ in Cos
(H. N. xi. 20).

105 Dolabellae] A con'ecture
founded on the fact that· . has
‘Dolabella est,’ and most MSS.
omit est. If so, the sense will be,
“The Dolabellas on this side, and
Antonius on that.” The Dolabellas
are Cneius, consul B.c. 81, prose-
cuted by Caesar B.c. 77 for extor-
tion in Macedonia, and acquitted;
Cneius, praetor 81, prosecuted B-C.
78 for extortion in Cilicia and con·
demned. Publius, Cicero’s son-in·

law, consul Rc. 44, shewed great
rapacity on his route to Syria. An·
tonius, the brother of the orator and

uncle of the triumvir, consul B.c. ⁸

63 : condemned after his return from
the government of Macedonia.

106 Verres] A retainer of Sulla,
who governed Sicily during the re-
volt of Spartacus: it was convenient
to the government that he should
raise as large a revenue from the
province as possible: he did raise
a large revenue ς but his adminis-
tration was so cynically reckless
that his was selected as the test case
to support the measure of trans·
ferring the judicia from the exclu-
sive possession of the Senate. Cf.
Verr. Act. ii. iv. 25, where Cicero
winds up a -story of L. Piso Frugi
with the remark,—-“Nimirum ut
hic [Verres] nomen suum compro·
bavit, sic ille [Piso] cognomen‚''
which proves that Verres had no
gentile name3 sor if he had, Verres
would not have ceased to be his
primary cognomen, because Frugi
was the secondary cognomen of
Pisa—Altis, “loaded with high
piles of plunder’'?

107 epona] “Spolium est quic·
quid de hostibus tollitur'’ (Serv. ad
Aen.,viii. 202).-De pace, ‘de pa·
catis.
