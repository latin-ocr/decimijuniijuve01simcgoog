count ,upon receiving the legacies which might be left them,
when Caesar administered to the estate of every man who had
ever been heard to say that Caesar would be his heir. We
are ·left to form· our opinion of the rapacity of the imperial
government from a good deal of general declamation and from
one· or two specific instanceS, doubtless taken from extreme
cases It is probable that the material loss was not what the
