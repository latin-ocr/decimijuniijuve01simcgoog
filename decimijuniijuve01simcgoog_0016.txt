'xiv INTRODUCTION.

'aud tha't Juvenal was indulging in a rather flat mystification‚
when he introduced an imaginary Mentor to warn -him of the
danger of denouncing Tigellinus, andpropitiates his phantom
monitor by a promise only to attack the dead.· For if Tigel-
linus is merely the disguise of another reigning favourite, it
would be necessary to prove, in the first place, that Tra-jan
had a favouritc who had power to persecute3 and impossible
to prove, in the second place, that any danger of the kind,
which may have existed, could be avoided by only admitting
names whose owners had departed3 for Tigellinus had been
dead nearly forty years 3 and the warning implies that his name
was a transparent pseudonym for some well-known character,
whom Juvenal's public were certain to recognize as the evil

meant, the allusion to CrispinuS, in v. 27, is no objection to
the theory that most of the satire was written under Nero, who
raised Crispinus to the Senate, according to Probus», though
his fortune culminated under Domitian.

Rhme 3 old enough, in fact, to guarantee the security of N ern.
Further on, at v. 193, the author speaks of his contemporaries
as selling themselves to the stage and the arena, without a
Nero to compel them3 and at v. 221, we are informed that
the musical tastes of Nero were the worst atrocity which called
for the righteous vengeance of Vindex and Galba. Of course
. these last lines must have been written after Nero’s death3
and they explain the ambiguity of¹ v. 198, where citharaedo
principe, &c- must mean after an emperor had taken to music ς
what wonder that the nobility took to pantomime? for nullo
