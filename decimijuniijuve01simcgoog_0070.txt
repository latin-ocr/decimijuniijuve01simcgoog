“Tu quoque magnam

79, 80] ‘⁴ To sum up all, out os all
possible nations, Daedalus was an
Athenian. '’

81, 82] Instead of the toga the
Greek factotum wears a gay out-
landish mantle, conchylia τ the patron
asks him to witness his will, sig-nabit,
before the old client, and gives him
a better lace at his table.

84, 855 “Is it so mere a nothing
that my ehildhood breathed the air
of Aventine’' (which is the proper
olace for an honest Plebeian to be

born), ‘⁴ and was reared'’ (not on the
choice fruits of the East, but) ‘⁶ on
the good old Sabine olive ?’'

86 Laudat} finds a way to praise.

88, 89] They are ingenious, as
well as bold. The patron is not a
strong man, he has a long throat,
he tries to carry his head well up.
This reminds them of Hercules'
bull neck—when it was stretched
upwards and backwards.

the cock, when he seathers his hen,

Νιεεοῦδέ, not even: it gains the
sense somehow as follows [nothing
makes a worse noise]. “nor the cock

which it is easy to omit the clause
in brackets,

that privilege is left us.
