sor he almost always felt himself isolated, and distrusted every·
body, even those who professed attachment and aspired to his
intimacy. During the first century of our era few men at
Rome acquired or retained power in the state without having
denounced disaffection to the person of the emperor. Such
denunciations became necessary as a pledge. of loyalty after a
man had risen, they were convenient while a man was rising:
under the conditions of the Roman state it was useful to an

by obliging one man he commonly disobliged another; by
ruining one man he terrorised all. Nor does Tacitus leave an
attentive reader under the impression that these denunciations
were exactly frivolouS. The Roman criminal law was terribly

empire for offences against morality and religion as sor attempts
against the security or the dignity of the emperor. To take one
instance out of many, there is not really any better reason for
doubting that Barea and his daughter had been guilty of a

every emperor the government felt itself too insecure to tolerate
disaffection3 the political classes insisted on keeping up the
habitos treating almost every emperor as an usurper, and speak-
