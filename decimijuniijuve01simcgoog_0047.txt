v. 48. The last omission is approved by G. Hermann, and of
course by Heinrich. ‘Francke also condemns vv. 97, 98, which
are too bad for any interpolator who knew, what Juvenal did
-not when he wrote thern, what was coming next. Orelli and
Francke show their taste by omitting from Elementa in v. 86 to
reor in v. 87, and from nec enim in v. 107 to putant in v. 108,
respectively.

In the Sixteenth Satire, nobody condemns any thing, though
some condemn every thing. It is fortunate that these ques-
tions may be answered one way or another without affecting
our judgement of Juvenal's meaning, without materially affect-
ing our judgement of his literary form3 for, as we have seen,
they must be answered, if at all, with little help from external
evidence.

The principa] manuscript authority for the text of Juvenal
is at present inaccessible, and our knowledge of it depends
· chiefly on Pithou’s collation in the sixteenth century, when
it was at Buda3 it is now said to be at Monte Pessu10. It
is very carelessly written, as are the ancient Scholia, which
seem to rank next in the confidence of the best editorS.
Here are a few readings from Pithou’s MS„ which 1 have
sometimes cited in the notes as P., taken from the First
Satire alone :—

v. 3 5. Quem Massa tim etque munere palpat, for Quem
Massa timet, quem munere palpat. “

v. 38. lVontib . . with two letters erased, for noctibuS.

v. 53. A adio medeas, for Aut Diomedeas.

v. 85. Votum ira voluptas, for votum timor ira voluptas.

v. 102. Prior inquit et &a ads-um for Prior inquit egv
adsum.

v. 106. Purpurac for purpura, to the destruction of the
mette.

The Scholia have the look of being copied from notes care-
lessly made from dictation, for where Juvenal's words are
given they are frequently spelt phonetically, so as to repre-
sent a later pronunciation.
