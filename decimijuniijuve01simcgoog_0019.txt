well as his malice late3 for he must have been n'early severity,
and may have been nearly eighty when Domitian died. His
own death, if he began to write in middle life under Ner0,
must f be placed early in Trajan's reign, 'and this would
account for the remarkable absence of all distinct allusion
to Trajan’s victorieS, which would ¹have been quite in place
in the vEighth Satire, or in the Fourteenth, where, on'
the contrary, he implies (v. 193) that frontier hostilities of
the most paltry kind afford 'thez only chance of military dia:
tinction. Nor is it likely that he undertook any fresh satires .
under Trajan, except perhaps the Sixteenth‚ which would suit
very well with a time-,when a little 'military insolence· was ·the÷
most serious evil which a satirist with failing powers could²
select for attack. If 'the fragment be the prologue to a satire
on military corruption, and maladministration, its date· would-
naturally be carried back to the time of Domitian's 'efforts to
ingratiate himself with the soldiery, which began with the
German campaign, 84 A. D.

From this sketch it appears that Juvenal must hav-e been
from five-and-twenty to thirty years 'in writing sixteen satires;
one a fragment ; and , the difficulty is not greatly diminished
if we take the second 'Junius and Fonteius; for even then
his li'terary activity must be made to extend from the death
of Domitian to at least 120 A.1>. Nor can we assume that
Juvenal wrote slowly because he wrote in a laboured sgyle3
for StatiuS, whose style is far more laboured, has left it on
record that he finished poems as long as most of Juvenal's‘
satires in two or three dayS. of course it is possible to find
a reason for many delays in the evidence, external and in-
ternal, that Juvenal's satires passed through much in the way
, of revision and expansion. Maternus (Tac. de Orat. 111. 2, 3)·
could recite a tragedy on Cato one day, and the next sit down
to consider how many fiCato’s tirades or epigrams (it is dis-
tressing not to know which) should be transferred to Thyeste83
but Maternus was almost as exceptional as Southey, who-finished
one epic over night and wrote a hundred lines of another
