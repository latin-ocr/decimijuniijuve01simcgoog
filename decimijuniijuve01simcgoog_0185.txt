Effigies inter vestras statuamque Vagelll.'’

Accipe quae contra valeat solatia ferre,

Et qui nec Cynicos, nec Stoica dogmata legit
A Cynicis tunica distantia, non Epicurum
Suspicit exigui laetum 'plantaribus horti.'
Cur-entur dubii medicis majoribus aegri:

Tu venam vel discipulo committe Philippi.

Si nullum in terris tam detestabile factum

Ostendis, taceo; nec pugnis caedere pectus

Te veto, nec plana faciem contundere palma
Quandoquidem accepto claudenda est janua damno,

Et majore domus gemitu, majore, tumultu · τ 30
Planguntur nummi, quam funera„ Nemo dolorem

Fingit in hoc casu, vestem diducere summam

Contentus, vexare oculos humore coacto.

Ploratur lacrimis amissa pecunia veriS.

· 119 vatem] “ Declamatoris mu-
lino corde Vagelli” (xvi. 23). Obvi-

sought it simply by the rejection of
superfluities: accordingly they wore
the pallium double and dispensed
with the tunic; the Stoics held that

fluities by wearing a coarse cloak.
It is worth noticing that the early
Buddhist ascetics who regarded as-
ceticism as a means for the salvation
of the world were models of decorum,
while the contemporary Brahmani-
cal ascetics for whom asceticism was

either an instrument of personal
salvation or perhaps more frequently
a condition of pretematural power
were cynically shameless in their
obtrusive mortifications.

123 exiguas—horn] As Epicurus
was so easily pleased he would
never have thrown himself into an
excitement about a hundred pounds;
his name is introduced to shew that
both the sects in vogue were in-
dependent enough of circumstances
to rebuke Calvinus.

prentice.”

127 pugnis] To make a good

128 plana] For you don't want

129 claudenda est] As we pull
down blinds between a death and a

funeral.

“To part the upper edge of the ‚
