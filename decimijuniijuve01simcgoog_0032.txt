esteem. Cotta seems to have been honestlyin favour-of· a strict
and severe system of administration3 but only a system of conr·
sistent tolerance and mutual support could have enabled the
senate to hold its own against Tiberius—and Cotta is con-
demned accordingly. Juvenal does not differ from Tacitus in '
his judgment on the rank and file of the delahres, who owed
,their influence exclusively to their activity in providing the
govemment with victimS. ' Their activity in reality pressed quite
as severely on the bourgeotlrie as on the aristocracy. Not im·
probably the government of a Domitian shed less blood forits
own - protection in all the Roman empire than many of the
mediaeval tyrannies of Italy, and those not the worst, shed in a
single year. A large and active class of informers was hardly
required to provide for all the executions that we have reason
to suspect. But the exchequer which had to provide so many
largesses for spendthrist nobles, for men of letters en dtis-poni-

it. The rights of the fiscus were as extensive and undefined

be plausibly represented as due to the' emperor. These were
imperfectly reassured when a well-intentioned sovereign decreed
that the informers should be punished if they prosecuted with-
out the sanction of the advocatus fisci, though of course it was
possible for private persons to ascertain the instructions and to ·
calculate the action osa known and responsible official. Under
Domitian and other emperors who, as Domitian himself. observed‚

impossible for a senator to feel that his property was his own, it
