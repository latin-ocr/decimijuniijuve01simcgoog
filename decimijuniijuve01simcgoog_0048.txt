xlvi INTRODUCTION.

Our instances shall be taken from the Seventh Sathez on
v. 2 we have the note Camenas. tacentibus poetis—where the
lecturer must have meant to explain tristes, while the scholar
took down the least important part of the heading. In the
same way in v. 7, Clio heads the following note—id est osti-
arius vel custos atriensis. Here the explanation is so curtailed
as to be grammatically incomplete3 but this might be due to
a wish for brevity. When, however, we see that the pupil
has only taken down the last word of the clause (migraret
in atria Clio), which the lecturer recalled for comment, we
are inclined to set down the mutilated form of the note to
the hurry of dictation. Here is a stronger instance of the
same kind, from the note on v. 83 ι “Promisitque D. 73 Letam.
Ideo quia libenter audiebat. Est enim et ῥύεταί poema delectabile
et ipse dicitur bonam vocem babuisse? when the annotator
obviously did not know whether the lecturer was explain-
ing laetam or tanta dulcedine captos, and accordingly tried to
put down both.

Rather higher up we have a confusion of another kind on
v. 73, Pignemt Atreus, fenerator. id est, qui Atreum scribit et ut
sumptus habeat res suas pignori dat,· where the first part of the
note is a perverse explanation of the single word Atreus, and
the second a perfectly correct paraphrase on the whole line..
On v. 80 we read, Marmoreis et Serrano. ,Nomina sunt poe—
tarum pauperum. At· Serrano vas fictile in quo At. Serranus
solebat manducare. Saleio ut mendica Catilum fictilem in quo
ea quae salsa sunt apponuntur. Tffis note embodies both the
forms of confusion which arise respectively from inaccuracy
in taking down the master-'s wordS, and from mixing up two
distinct explanationS. Valla's quotation from Probus throws
some light on the source of the latter ambiguity. Nomina
fuisse poetarum Probus putat, alii “ sarrhaen0,'’ ut idem ait, et
“ saleio'' vasa accipiunt fictam? juniores vero “ salino '⁹ legunt et
“ sarrano,” ut, per vas in quo sal componitur, quaeque vilissima
intelligamus. The same satire supplies a fair crop of mere
clerical errors, such as would arise from a careless attempt to.
