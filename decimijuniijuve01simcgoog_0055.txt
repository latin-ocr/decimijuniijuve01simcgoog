began their rhetorical education with
litical suasoriae, and went on to
egal controversiae.

20 Auruncae] Suessa Aurunca,
where Lucilius was born.

23] Praetising as a ‘ bestiaria‚’
in the costume of an Amazon. This
profession, and that of gladiator,
was opened to women under Nero,
and closed to them by SeveruS.

25] Repeated (x. 226).

26 cauom] Canopus was to
Alexandria what Greenwich and
Rotherhithe are to London, a town
of sailors and their parasites‚ some·
times visited by pleasure·seekers
from the capital, cf. xv. 46 n.

27 onspmus] A favourite of Do-
mitian, flattered by Martial, cf. iv.
24. According to the Scholiast he
was raised to the senate by Nero, it
would be natural however to take
the next line as an allusion to his
equestn'an rank, cf. vii. 89, Semen-

stri vatum digitos circumligat auro.

28] His fingers sweat under his
light summer ring of plain gold.
At the same time it probably refers
to a personal peculiarity: the least
thing made him perspire because he
took no exercise, cf. ιν. 108 n.

29 ‘madoris gemmae] A gem of
any Size. .

32 caustum—Mathonis] Mathois
a bankrupt (vii. 129) ; abraggart (xi.
34)5 and a standing butt of Martial.
Causidicus is a mere hack pleader in
Cicero, who wrote when advocates
were still patrous, not mere servants ·
of their clients. Tr. When coun-
cillor Matho comes by in his new
litter, and his worship fills it. As
it was not usual for two peopleto
ride in a litter, {vso must be a sneer
at Matho‘s dignity and cannot be
taken as emphasising plena which is
a sneer at his size.
