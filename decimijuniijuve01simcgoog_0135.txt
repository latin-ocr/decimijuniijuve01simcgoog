in destroying the last republican
army at Philippi.

Both Octavian and Cicero were
hailed pater patriae ; but in Cicero's
case it was the voice of Rome, not
of a distant battle-field3 of peace,
not of war ; of liberty, not of
slavery.—Tharsaliae campis. The
Romans believed that the battles
of Philippi were 'fought on the
same ground as Pharsalia, from the
ambiguity of bis and iterum, and the
inaccurate use of Aemathia (Verg.
Geor. ι. 489, 491).

expresses the condition is in the
subjunctive, and the principal verb
is the indicative, the princi al clause
is really independent. T e condi·
tional clause is added as a correc-
tion, and implies a suppressed
apodosis also in the subjunctive: do-
labra would be used to point the
stakes sor the vallum. ,
