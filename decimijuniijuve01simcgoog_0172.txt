Ι). JUNII CJUVENALIS

Rectoris conferret opem: decidere jactu
Coepit cum ventiS, imitatus castora, qui se

Eunuchum ipse facit, cupiens evadere damno

Testiculi: adeo medicatum intelligit inguen.

“ F undite, quae mea sunt, '³ dicebat, ‘⁴ cuncta‚'’ Catullu5‚
Praecipitare volens etiam pulcherrima, vestem
Purpuream, teneris quoque Maecenatibus aptam,

Atque aliaS, quarum generosi graminis ipsum

Infecit natura pchS, sed et egregius sons

Viribus occultis et Baeticus adjuvat aer.

Ille nec argentum dubitabat mittere, lances

Parthenio factaS, urnae cratera capacem,

Et dignum sitiente Pholo vel conjuge F usci; 45
Adde et bascaudas et mille escaria, multum

‘Caelati, biberat quo callidus emtor Olynthi.

Sed quis nunc aliuS, qua mundi parte, quis audet

Argento praeferre caput rebusque salutern?

33 decidere] means a bargain,
especially a compromise with credi-
tors ; so Martial tells Domitian, that
if the gods wished to square ac-
counts with him, Heaven would be
bankrupt, and Jove would not be
able to offer a whole penny in the
shilling (ix. 4).

37 Pandite] Most of Catullus’
stores were too light to make the
ship labour, and accordingly we
hear that she was not cased by
parting with them3 he seems to
have had a crazy sear of drowning,
which was no better than a stupe-
·· fying sear of poverty.

40 quarum—pecus] “ The flocks
whereos, the ssocks that supply
these. '’ On the Guadalquivir the
sheep have a sort of golden wool, or
a deep brown. ‚The passage looks

· an· unsuccesssul attempt at a sneer,

as if Juvenal would have said ‘ ‘Which
realises the apocalyptic promises of
the Pollio, about sheep running
about with their fleeces ready dyed,

only the air and the water have
something to do with it too.''

44 Parthenio motas] “ Which
Parthenius could claim as his work ;''
this is the force of the dative (cs. i.

, n.).
54- urnae] About 3 gallons: of
course the crater held more, though
it is not clear how much. Juvenal ·
means to say either that it would
hold 3 gallons of wine, and water in
proportion, or more· probably, as
water was drawn in an urna, that it
would hold 3 gallons of water, and
lxine'in plrloporuon, about 4 or 5 gal-
ons in a .

45 conjuge Pascis Of course a

well-known character. Juvenal, un- ,

like Martial‚ never proclaims his
respect for the sanctity os private
lise, and it may be doubted whether
even Martial avoided butts too no·
torious to be hurt by a jo’ke.

47 callidus emtor olynthi] Phili ,
quoted as a rich drinker who cou d
employ old Greek artist52 · .
