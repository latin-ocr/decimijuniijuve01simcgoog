INTRODUCTION. ’ xlix

vires, the majority have bilis, whieh being coarser, is not less
likely to be genuine. At xn. 92, the corrector and all the
other MSS. but one have operatur sesta; P. or his original did
not see that janua was the nominative, and so introduced an
impossible plural to agree with festa. At x111. 28, P. has nunc,
which is flat, but needs no explanation, and looks like a cor-
rection of the difficult nona, which is supported by the variant
nova, though this last must be later than nunc, as dating from
an age when prosody was forgotten. At v. 208 P. has saeva
voluntas, probably an inaccurate reproduction of scaeva voluntas,
which is a perverse attempt to improve on sola, the reading of
the great majority of MSS. Lastly, P. has not retained the
· original order of xv. and xv1., and its reading Junco at XV. 27,
looks very like an attempt to improve metre at the expense of
history.

Though these instances may tend in some measure to
prove that P.’s archetype was not written with uniform fidelity‚
I have not the least wish to set aside the judgment of such
scholars as Jahn or C. F. Hermann on its general superiority.
Perhaps it would be too much to say that the defects of
Pithou's MS. illustrate the uncertainty of the guidance which ·
the best scholars are compelled to trust, and that C. F. Her-

mann’s old corrector may sometimes have had better materials
than his critic.
