SATIRA XI.

115

Non Phryx aut LyciuS‚ non a mangone petitus
Quisquam erit3 in magno quum posceS, posce Latine.
Idem habitus cunctiS, tonsi rectique capilli,

Atque hodie tantum propter convivia pexi.

150

Pastoris duri est hic filius, ille bubulci:
Suspirat longo non visam tempore matrem
Et casulum, et notos tristis desiderat haedoS,
Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoriS,

Quales esse decet, quos ardens purpura vestit:

Nec pupillares defert in balnea raucus

T esticuIOS, nec vellendas jam praebuit alaS‚
Crassa nec opposito pavidus tegit inguina gutt0.
· Hic tibi vina dabit, diffusa in montibus illis,

A quibus ipse venit, quorum sub vertice lusit:

160

Namque una atque eadem est vini patria atque ministri.-
Forsitan exspecteS, ut Gaditana canoro

Incipiat prurire choro, plausuque probatae

Ad terram tremulo descendant 'clune puellae:

Spectant hoc nuptae juxta recubante marim,

clad, being used to live out of
(101)ἑὲ tn magno quum posces]
“When you call for a bumper.’'
Most MSS. give the obvious guess
et magno as an addition to what
ἕὲἓέῗὲἷῗὲἓὶ δὲἒὲἓ* Ὧῒςιὲαέῗὲῗ

sends st b asking, Why should he

, - not call or a small cup? Because

the slave would hand it as a matter
of course. ·

149 Idem habitus cunctis] I have
no special favourite.

153 notos] You will srighten him,
you are a stranger.

154, 155] My slave is an ex·-

ample of modesty to ‘ ingenui?

156 pupillares] Probably simply
under age, ι ‘thougllgs 111ιὲ δῗὲῗοξῗεῒ Α ἐξ
ἷὲᾆζῖῃῐὲᾆη 11311ιέ1, scilicet tumgn‘ies
m icen ia pueri iae.

165

157 vellendas jam praebuit alas]
As a debauched master might say
pf a slave that was growing up too⁴
ast.

159] The wine is not of the fa·
mous Greek kinds or of the choice
sorts of south Italy.

162 Gaditana] Dancing girls
seem to have been the principal and.
absorbing luxury of this great tra-
ding station, which was founded by
orientals before the Greek and Ro-
man forms of dissipation· were in-
vented, nor were these, if they ever
penetrated as far as Gades, so well
suited to elderly business men, who
must have given the tone, as the
dreamy contemplation of voluptuous
danceS.

165, 166] are so hopelessly
without a place, that they are
omitted in the same sort of MSS.
as omit 108. Others place them

8—2
