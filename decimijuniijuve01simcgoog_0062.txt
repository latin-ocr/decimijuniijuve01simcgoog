and dishonoured (inf. 133), Juvenal
would have made a point of this,
and instead of complaining that they
had to buy their dinner‚ he would
have· said that they had nothing to
buy it with.

Apollo] The group of Apollo
and Marsyas “ in foro Augusti.”
Hence juris peritus. It was made
of ivory. Cf. Hor. 1. Sat. ix. fin.:
‘⁶ Sic me servavit Apollo,” after the
bore has been carried off into court;
and for Marsyas (ib. ii. 119 sqq.):
“ Deinde eo dormitum, non solicitus,
mihi quod cras Surgendum sit mane,
obeundus Marsya, qui se Vultum
ferre negat noviorum sse minoris.’'
He is glad that he s not to rise
early to pay his court, and keep an
appointment in the city, where the
men on ’Change are such harpies
that their shy looks flog Marsyas
over agam.
