to make himself the butt, or a butt of his own satire. Horace
would certainly have smiled at the servility of his imitators;
one of whom deprecated a persecution which he never did
anything to provoke, and anticipated‚ with a comic mixture
of vanity and cowardice, the martyrdom which he was never
to undergo, while 'the other published his exaggerated terrors
after he had experienced how little a Satirist had to sear, even
from a tyrannical emperor. Again, Horace's mentor is care-
fully individualized by a certain dogmatic dulness and oracular

. ·vapidity, while both Persius and Juvenal are content to ven-

triloquize through a colourless puppet,‚who might be made to
say one thing as well as another. Yet it cannot be doubted
that both Persius and Juvenal tried intelligently to improve
upon Horace.

If one were to endeavour to select the gravest fault of
Horace’s SatireS, probably a sort of pointless garrulity would
occur at once to most of his readers, His good things are
embedded in a torrent of commonplace‚ which, doubtleSS,
catches the tone of well-bred conversation very well, as he is
rather fond of boasting; but this only proves that the ordinary
conversation of the very best society will not bear to be repro-
duced at length. In addition to something which is almost
tediousness, we miss the half ideal medium, which any tolerable
system of conventional poetic diction secureS, even when it is
as unreal as Juvenal's, who often trusts to unintelligent reminis-
cences of Horace, for the names of hostile tribes on the Roman
frontier, and for the status of Roman families. Juvenal is
never incomplete, he is never abrupt‚ he has an habitual sense
of what is due to the finish and dignity of literature. He is
one of the smoothest and clearest of writers; and this is pro·
bably what Acron means when he speaks of his “suavity‚”
which he contrasts with the “asperity'' of Lucilius, It is easy
to believe that there was a freshness and a raeiness about
Lucilius that made his jolting and disjointed invectives interest-
ing reading to people who read much. Acron praises Horace
for combining this “ asperity’' with the ‘⁴ suavity'’ of Juvenal.
