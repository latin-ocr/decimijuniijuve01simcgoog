D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA XIII.

Exmno quodcunque malo committitur, ipsi

Displicet auctori. Prima est haec ultio, quod se

Judice nemo nocens absolvitur, improba quamvis

Gratia fallaci Praetoris vicerit urna.

Quid sentire putas omneS, Calvine, recenti · , 5
De scelere et fidei violatae crimine? Sed nec

Tam tenuis census tibi contigit, ut mediocris

Jacturae te mergat onus: nec rara videmus,

Quae pateriS. Casus multis hic cognituS, ac jam

TrituS, et e medio fortunae ductus acervo, 10³
Ponamus nimios gemitus: flagrantior aequo

Non debet dolor esse viri, nec vulnere maj0r.

Tu quamvis levium minimam exiguamque malorum
Particulam vix ferre poteS, spumantibus ardens

VisceribuS, sacrum tibi quod non reddat amicus 15

2 aneton] The man who sets a
bad precedent is auctor to those who
follow it for acting like him.

4 urna] The balloting urn, where
the votes were put, not the lottery
urn, for the preliminary sortitio, where
gratia would have less weight than
in the final decision.

5 recentl] Till they have got
used to the sense of guilt.

6 scelere] Scelus is the internal
stain, crimen the public liability 3
probrum the social disgrace, flagi·
tium the public scandal 3 as we say,
a ‘⁴ burning shame ;’' facinus wavers
between our word ‘feat,’ and the
Scotch quasi-legal term ‘fact,’ which
is generally opprobrious. ι

—- Sed neo, δα] The connection
is, A rogue is sufficiently punished
by his conscience, but, apart stom
that, you have no excuse for fuming
at such a common trifle.

13, 14 quamvis levium] “How-
ever light, '⁹ “ as light as you please.”
It might seem that persons whom
the consciousness of very small in-
jur-ies or missortunes afflicts with a
sense of intolerable misery were as
reasonable as those whom the· con-
sciousness of very- small faults as-
flicts with a sense of intolerable sin.
But the majority os right-minded
people proceed on the assumption
that it is right to be as anxious as

, possible about perfection and as in·
