INTRODUCTION. xxi

reflected even upon him by the circumstance that there were
occasions in the life of every ambitious man that made it
worth his while to prosecute, if only that he might measure
his strength against some personage of established reputation.
Besidea civil relations were less regular and less definite than
they became aster the legislation of Augustus», and interests of
all kind came„ more frequently into collision. Under ‘the
empire all this was changed ε- the political rewards of the
bar were curtailed ς its honourable influence in politics was
all but destroyed. Those who prosecuted occasionally for
ambition, and those who prosecuted habitually as a trade,

of political influence after he had ceased to desire the reality,

and to make a pretence of having clientS, in order, if possible,
to attract customerS, · and ‘this perversity of their position made .

use for clients. The same change took place in England at the

beginning of the seventeenth century, and is bewailed in the
