“Ready to cluteh, ere long, at the
remains of the nobility whom all
devour.” He means their persons,
not their property. Merivale‚ viii.
158, identifies the delator with Mern-
mius Regulus, consul A.D. 63.
The Scholiast says he is HeliodoruS,
who is otherwise unknown, unless
he could be identified with Helius,
under Nero; he says that others
referred to P. Egnatius Celer, iii.
116 n, others to a certain Demetrius
a causidicus like Matho ; he had
read of a Latinus, put to death by
Nero as an accomplice of Messalina.
Another Latinus was a mime under
Domitian, flattered by Martial.
Massa was already mischievous, Α. D.
70, when he betrayed Piso, and
was formidable under Domitian.
Carus had only one victory to boast
of when Agricola died, A.D. 93.

4ο] Gillo is heres ex deunce ;
Proculeius ex unciola, a paltry
twelsth.

have the paleness of a man who

sees a snake, in Virgil Aen. ii. 379
the alarm of a man who has trodden
upon a snake, the bare feet are
Juvenal's own.

44] W’here the unsuccessful com-
petitors in the literary contests insti·
tuted by Caligula had to provide
prizes for their betters, and the worst
had to efface their own compositions.

to recover to the amount of 700 ses-
tertia unlawfully received from de·
finite persons on definite grounds3
it is probable that the actual pro·
feeds of all his extortions were far

arger.

48 infamia] Which made a rich
man intestabilis
ηεξ transmissas
Rome. Cf. viii. 120.

50 victrix] Because the Africans,
thanks to the exertions of Pliny and
TacituS, secured his condemnation,
ploras because they were left im-
poverished.
