bably the commentator on Virgil). It may be well to exhibit
some specimens of this “ lieentia? taken chiefly, though not
exclusively, from the old corrector of Pithou’s MS, who
wished to bring his copy into respectable conformity to the
common ·type. In this endeavour he sometimes effaced the
original reading entirely, sometimes he left it legible besides
his own correction, so that it might perhaps be possible to
ascertain, if the MS. were now accessible, whether it was cor-
rected by two different handS, or whether the difference in
the style of the corrections is due to the fact that the same
owner went through the MS. twice, possibly with 'different
authorities· .

certainly looks like patching3 on the other hand, P. and the
Scholia have municipales at v. 34, which the corrector and the
interpolated MSS. give correctly. Two lines further on, the
corrector deliberately gives the difficult reading vulgus quem
lubet (unless he intended to write vulgi), while P. had· the easy
reading vulgus quum jubet, and other MSS. endeavour to meet
the difficulty by reading vulgi. Again at v. 218, the corrector
alters the easy reading Haec Asianorum, which is found in
P. and the Scholia, into the difficult ficasianorum, which the
other MSS. give with trifiing variationS, so that it seems th'at

remove a difficulty.
In XI. 38, P. had most probably culina, like two other

MSS, while the corrector and the maj0rity of MSS. read
crumina or crumena. At xr. 91, P. has postrema, the majority
