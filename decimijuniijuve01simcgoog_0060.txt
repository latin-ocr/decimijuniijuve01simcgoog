82 D. JUN'II JUVENALIS

Limine parva sedet, turbae rapienda togatae.
Ille tamen faciem prius inspicit et trepidat, ne
Suppositus venias ac falso nomine poscas.

⁴ Agnitus accipies3 jubet a praecone vocari

Ipsos Trojugena33 nam vexant limen et ipsi

Nobiscum. “Da praetori, da deinde tribun0.

Sed libertinus prior est.’' ‘⁸ Prior,” inquit, “ ego adsum:
Cur timeam, dubitemve locum defendere, quamvis
Natus ad Euphraten, molles quod in aure fenestrae

Arguerint, licet ipse negem? sed quinque tabernae

Quadringenta parant. Quid confert‚purpura maj0r
Optandum, si Laurenti custodit in agro ῃ
Conductas Corvinus oves Ρ ego possideo plus

Pallante et Licinis.”

Exspectent ergo tribuni;
Vincant divitiae, sacro nec cedat honori,

Nuper in hanc urbem pedibus qui venerat albis:

97—102] The patron (ille) does
not trust to your giving a name on
the list which is in the hands of his
paymaster, you may be personating
some one wh0, you happen to know,
is absent, he makes the praeco (he
is a ‘rex' himself and keeps a h'e·
rald) call the list over and watches
himself to identify each applicant
as he· answers. Even nobles with
pedigrees as old as Troy submit to
this humiliation3 and though they
take precedence of you, a Syrian
freedman [Ρ a persumet] takes pre-
cedence of them.

104 molles—tenemae] The
marks of the h'eavy earring he had
worn till he became a Roman citi-
zen and abandoned such things to
women.

105] “My income from five
shop's, is equal to the ‘census eques-
ter.

“ 106—108]
c'ome 1 am as good as a senator, and
need not wish to be one 3 why,
Corvinus has to take other people's
sheep to graze on his land at Lau-

“With such an in-

rentium, and as we may say look
aster them himself, while 1 may be
richer than any sreedman.'' Lauren-
tium was a great grazing country.
Corvinus is probably the great-grand-
son of the patron of Tibullus: in
A.D. 59 he was consul with Nero,
who assigned him a pension of 503
sestertia a year, a larger income than
the freedman's after all. Conductas
pascit, i. q. pascendas conducit.

109 Pallas] A sreedman of Clau·
dius, by whose interest his brother
Felix was made procurator ofJudea.
Licinus, a freedman of C. Julius
Caesar, made a fortune by plunder-
ing Gaul. Horace mentions a barber
of the name (A. P. 301), to whom
the Scholiast refers (sup. 25). If he .
is right, both are mentioned here3
but Mayor and Macleane duly notice
that Licinis for ‘a Licinus’ is a com-
mon construction, though it is more
natural to say, ‘⁶ More than Pallas
and the Licini,” than “ More than
Pallas and a Licinus.”

their feet chalked 3 perhaps that they
