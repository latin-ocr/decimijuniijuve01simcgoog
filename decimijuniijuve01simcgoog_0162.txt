D. JUNII · JUVENALIS

Ova adsunt ipsis curn matribus, et servatae

Parte anni, quales fuerant in vitibuS, uvae:

Signinum Syriumque pirum, de corbibus isdem

Aemula Picenis et odoris mala recentis,

N ec metuenda tibi, siccatum frigore postquam 75
Autumnum et crudi posuere pericula succi.

Haec olim nostri jam luxuriosa Senatus

Coena fuit. CuriuS‚ parvo quae legerat horto,

Ipse focis brevibus ponebat oluscula, quae nunc .

Squalidus in magna fastidit compede fossor, . · 80
Qui meminit, calidae sapiat quid vulva popinae. .

Sicci terga suiS, rara pendentia crate,

Moris erat quondam festis servare diebus

Et natalicium cognatis ponere lardum,

Accedente nova, si quam· dabat hostia, carne. 85
Cognatorum 'aliquis titulo ter consulis atque ’

7² Patteanni] “By the season ;”
‘⁸ By the cold os late autumn and
early winter.’' It is as well to keep
to the common instrumental sense
of the ablative3 as the abl. is seldom
used of duration, though instances
are found, as Cic. M D. ii. ἓ 130.
ss-Quales fuerant in vitibus, i. e.
not as raisins. Grapes were pre·
served ιιι air· tight casks‚ or sawdust,
or hung g.up and sometimes smoked
(Plin. HN. xv. 183 Varro, R. R.
i. 54). The last process would give
raisms·

74, 75]‘ ‘The fruit is fresh, as
having been carefully packed3 wh’ole-
some, as having been kept so long.‘’

78, 79] One learns of Curius:
that he had neither cook nor gardener
(ι’ se and le gterat) that he dined off

tables (oluscula): that he had
⁰555 a scanty supply of these (parvo
horto focas brevibus).

80 squalidus] Because he is out

of reach of baths.
81]‘ ‘Who can remember the taste

osa sow' s paunch ιιι a steaming cook· '

shopss ’which he used to frequent be·
fore he was banished from the city
establishment· very likely he was
banished artly for frequenting it.
Probably 81 are reminiscences of
Hor. Sat. 11. vii. 118, Ep. 1. xiv.
15-25.

82 rara] Constructed to hold
few flitches.

84 natalicium]‘ ‘For a birthday
feast,” in honour of the genius3
hence ‘hostiass The sacrificial
notion of a feast is very clearly
guen ιιι Aen. iii. 221, 222. —

‘Divosque ipsumque voca·
mus
'In partem praedamque Jovem.’' ”

Men were afraid to seed themselves
before the gods: The inadequacy
of this view is exposed' ιιι the Psalms
and ProphetS.
