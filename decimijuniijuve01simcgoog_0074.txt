162 Quanam—Aedilibus] Cf. su .
47: Nulli comes exeo, n. Here e
complains οξ the difficulty of getting,
not an appomtment on a governor s
staff, but a berth as assessor to the

degener gladiatori5,'' as if it was
unmanly of them not to be gladia-

161 sarcinulis] ‘Collige sarci·
nulas ‘ was a· form of divorce. It

gives her less than she brings him,''

her a house to put her things in.” · ,

Greeks, or in business, where he
is cut out by freedmen.

‘ Olim’ carries the mind back to a·

past time, at which it had long been
their duty to have emigrated, if the
tenses can be tabulated in order of

say, “they had ought,’' which is
exactly like ‘ debuerant‚' and means,
not that the duty had been long-
incumbent, but that it was unper-
formed. Cf. inf. 315, note.
