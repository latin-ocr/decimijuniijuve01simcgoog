All sorts of different readings have
been tried. One, cum posszlr, has got
into most MSS. Of course this
cannot be right as ‘possis is a spon·
dee. Possis· cum is so ugly that it
might easily have been altered, and
may be defended by ‘cocto num adest

fill up would be the lowest, on which
he lay himself, consequently the
discourtesy of his eating a good

site at his elbow a bad one would be
all the more glaring. Three was the
regular number to a couch. We

dwindled in common speech to
‘ligula.' and the Scholiast gives an
etymology to match.

received interpretation; but the dis·

the stars are still fadiug [in summer]‚

This would give more point to illo

hard to believe that the stars had
