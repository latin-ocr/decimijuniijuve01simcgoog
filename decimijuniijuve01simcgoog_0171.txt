Plurima. Pictores quis nescit ab Iside pasci?

Quum plenus fluctu medius foret alveus, et jam, 30·

things are as bad” (they cannot be
worse).

gnourssl that Catullus has suffered
loss as well as exceptional peril, and
immediately qualifies his appeal by
the admission that everybody who is
shipwrecked does lose his property.

28 Iside] A man ruined by a
shipwreek begged by exhibiting be'·

he was going to dedicate. C . 3—6.
Was it usual to make vows to orgi·
astic foreign deitieS, calm thank·
offerings to national gods! In the
time of Horace, Od. 1. v. 13—16,
the votive picture was still dedi-
cated to Neptune.

on her beam-endsss lit. ‘as the waves
heaved up each side of the vessel by

32 Arboris incertae] The passage
is clumsy upon any hypothesisz' if
we retain the reading of P. it will
be better to translate ‘the experience
of the gray steersman of the crazy
log‘ instead of putting arboris in-
certae in apposition to puppis.- there
is a plausible MS. variant, arboris
incerto, which may be taken either
with the previous line or with what
follows, meaning ‘as the tottering
mast made the ship roll’ or ‘ when no
skill could help the tottering mast-⁹
Lachmann has a pretty and credible
conjecture, A rbori incertae. One is
tempted to suspect that the verses

less an· accident where the second
should be inserted. If the mast
had been cut away immediately aster

'decidere jactu, there would be no

doubt as to the meaning of arbor,
which would unmistakably refer to
the mast. Taeda, inf. 59, is the only
colour for making arbor-ts mean ship.
