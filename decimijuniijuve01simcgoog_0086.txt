34 D. jUNH JUVENALIS

. Purpureus magni ructarit scurra Palati,

Jam princeps equitum, magna qui voce solebat
Vendere municipes fracta de merce siluros!
Incipe, Calliope, licet et considere: non est
Cantandum, res vera agitur: narrate, puellae 35
Pierides: prosit mihi vos dixisse puellas!

Juvenal wrote these lines to revenge
his banishment. This nickname of
Domitian seems to have passed into
a proverb, at least Ausonius quotes
it as such (Monost. 63 XII. Imp.
11,12).

animum, not with ultimus, though
that 1s possible. Nero had' knock-
ed half the life out of the world, and
Domitian was mangling the remain-
der. It is worth noticing that on
neither view does the writer make
any allowance sor Vespasian or Ti-
tus, though the one retained respect
and the other roused enthusiasm.

cusan refugees in the reign of
Dionysius.
