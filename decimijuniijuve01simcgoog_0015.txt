daim.-'?{ =‹›Here·· the sentence about Trajan³s philosopher, who
denounced and· condemned the‘noble- Barea, is an obvious
confusion due to the fact that, while Barea suffered under
⁶ Nero', the· annotator supposed for the mom'ent that Juvenal
was satirizing the reign of Trajan. Again, when we are told
that Messalina was the wife of· Nem, it is more than doubtful
whether we are to' give the deponent credit for remembering
that Nero was one ot the surnames of Claudius 3 nor is it

When we turn to Valla's excerpts from ProbuS, we find at

same favourite could 'be‘ an object of terror to members of·
Trajan' s household, and to a victim of Claudius or even Nero,
who certainly may have taken a fancy to avenge his stepfather²s
dishonour. -
It is probable that Probus was perplexed by what· 1s cer
tainly difficult to explain, ——the mention of a favourite of Nero
and a. corrupt governor under Trajan, in the same satire.
Probus dilutes the difficulty by multiplying allusions to Trajan,
, as well as to Nero, without inquiring whether Trajan· was. a,
contemporary of Tigellinus. The modernS, at any rate, since·
Madvig, have generally cut »the knot by supposing that: the·
