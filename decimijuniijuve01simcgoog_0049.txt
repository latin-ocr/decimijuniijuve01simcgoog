follow dictation: e.g. at v. 60 we have magne for magnae, at
v. 82 amice for amicae, at v. 208 spirandisquc for &hantis-que
or-spirantesque, at v. 23 1 ut [καί stertas- for ut legat historias,
just as in a note on Sat. 1. 1, which gives something like a life
of Juvenal„ the line that caused his banishment is quoted as
follows, Quod non dantproceres dabit strio. As these Scholia are
found in two MSS. at least, which often differ widely in their
readings, it seems likely that our present copies are derived
from an archetype annotated from dictation when Juvenal was
still regularly taught in schools. It is even possible that the
same MS. may have contained the annotations of successive
generatiOns of pagan and Christian teacherS, for besides the
incongruens explanations quoted above, there is a note on
xlv. 102, which -implies that Tacitus is the only authority
accessible on the subject of MoseS, while a note two lines
further on explains Quaesitum ad fontem of holy baptism.
But all speculations of this kind are most uncertain, for in
the absence of independent external evidence it is impossible
to limit the number of hypotheses which may be constructed
to meet the limited facts. Still there can be little doubt
that, in one form or another, the Scholia do contain the re-
siduum of the old grammatical tradition, and this gives an
authority to their readingS, and even their interpretationS,
which is certainly not due to the intelligence of those who
have transmitted them to us, for Probus had access to many
authorities now lost, though he may not always have used
the-m critically. ¹
The authority osPithou's MS. seems to rest largely on the
frequency of its blunders and the originality of its · spelling,
which together· seem to prove that any good reading which it
contains must rest wholly on its intermittent fidelity to a very
ancient text. All the other MSS. are in C. F. Hermann’s
judgment “ maltzplici vetetis corrector& licentia deformata.n
Perhaps the corrector may have been N iceus, who, as we
leam from· one of Jahn’s MSS„ read and emended the -first
