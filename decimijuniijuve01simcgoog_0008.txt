vi PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

was right in more than one passage, especially on
questions of punctuation where in the first instance 1
had followed Mayor. Wherever the text was simply
a matter of manuscript authority, 1 have been glad to
give {Jahn’s' without 'discussions whete the va‘r'ious read-
ings affected the sense'or had a character of their own,
it seemed better to choose sor mysels and to give my .
reasons: there is always something irritating about an
edition which indicates a variety os reading without
giving a clue to the editor’s principle os selection.

Juvenal is a writer in whom every attentive reader
may hope to discover something ·sresh, while every
reader whose vigilance has not been chastened into
sagacity must expect sometimes to discover more than ’
is there ; but in dealing with Juvenal it is safest to err⁸
οη the side os exceSS. In a highly literary age artificial
connexions and effects occur more readily than⁴ natural ;
a writer can hardly employ an expression which does
not imply a train os hals-forgotten thought. The
chronology of Juvenal’s lise and writings suggested· in
the Introduction, which has been materially expanded,
is of course very precarious; but it seems to rest upon
facts which have still to find their place in a really⁶
adequate conception of his system of satirical· allusion.

Three satires have been altogether omitted as not
required in University Examinations, which proceed on
the creditable'hypothesis2that all candidates for a pass
or honours either possess or cultivate the temper to
which such reading is as painful as it ought to be.
