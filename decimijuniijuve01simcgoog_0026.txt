nal was well to do he was all the fitter to represent the griev-
ances of the gregarious idlers who loitered away dreamy days
between the baths and the sorum, and scarcely ever felt life
worth living except while the excitement of the circus roused
them for a moment from their apathetic unrest.

In reading Tacitus we are never allowed sor an instant to
escape from the impression that the tyranny of the imperial
govemment was the crying evil of the age and the parent of all
' the rest; in the letters of Pliny (though he represents perhaps a
later period than Juvenal) we see something of the bright side
of that part of Roman society to which imperial tyranny was

the one flaw in an universe otherwise admirable. But Juve- ·

eighth satire is one long commentary on the impotence of the
class whose oppressive pretensions still kept new men in the

stinging invective on the indescribable vices of a class whose
chosen hero was the emperor Otho, because his momentary
energy and the careless gallantry of his end seemed to be a
pledge to them that they had not unmanned themselves by
pmfligacy which he had exceeded. They might quote the
austere Tacitus and the complaisant Martial in support of their
homage to their favourite; but he made no impression whatever
on the sturdy puritanism of Juvenal. The third and fifth satires
