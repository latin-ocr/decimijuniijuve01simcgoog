32 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA IV.

Ecca iterum CrispinuS, et est mihi saepe vocandus

Ad parteS, monstrum nulla virtute redemtum

A vitiis 3 aegrae solaque libidine fortes ·

Deliciae, vid uas tantum aspernatur adulter.

Quid refert igitur, quantis jumenta fatiget 5
Porticibu5‚ quanta nemorum vectetur in umbra,

Jugera quot vicina foro, quas emerit aedes?

Sed nunc de factis levioribus: et tamen alter

Si fecisset idem, caderet sub judice morum.

9 Incestus] Incestum could only
be committed with a person with
whom it was morally as well as
legally impossible to contract a
virtuous marriage. According to
Roman notions there was the same
moral impossibility of a valid mar·
riag e between any man and a Vestal
whgo had not served out her thirty
yearS, as between a brother and
sister.

ιο] Domitian had revived this
punishment in an arbitrary way, so
Juvenal says, “to what a risk Cris-
pinus exposed his Vestal!” in a se·
