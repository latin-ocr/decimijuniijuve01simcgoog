296 quaero] According to Mad·
vig (Opusc. ii. 40), in Latin, Ger-
man, and Danish, the pres. ind. is
used in questions addressed to one-

self‚ as ‘⁸ Stantes plaudebant in re ·

ficta: quid arbitramur in vera fac·
turos fuisse?'’ (Cic. Lael. ἕ 24), or
others, as inf. iv. 130 3 Cic. ad Att.
xii. 40: “Quid mihi auctor es?
advolone ‘an maneo?'’ when the
answer is altogether independent ot
the speaker’s opinion, being either
obvious or dependent upon the
person questioned. Our only equi-
valent for this idiom, and the con-

professional thies. He’ll be upon
you as soon as the streets are still,
with the houses shut and shops

tioned, because a th1ef would find
these more interesting than the
streets by day, or because his victirn
might take refuge there) ; ‘⁴ or per·
haps a highwayman does the busi-
ness quicker with the sword. When·
ever the Pomptine marshes and the
fir-woods above Cumae'’ (where to
be sure Umbricius was· going, but
though they attacked travellers they
hardly cared about the plunder oi
a small town whose inhabitants
came there for economy) “are made
safe, thereupon they leave them,
and run to Rome, as if it was their
preserve.'' ·
