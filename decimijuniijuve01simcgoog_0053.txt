r reponam] May be future or
subjunctive. Ι prefer the latter.
“Am Ι never to reply?” if so,
impune recitaverit, “ Is he not to
be punished for having recited ?''
Any way the passage shews the
very close affinity of the future tense

2 toties] It lasted so many re·
citations.—C0rdi, a stock character

in a play of Euripides now lost

tious poverty and fluent sophistry.
He and Orestes are subjects of tra·
gedy ε the epics of the day are cha-
racterized, fr. 6—12.

summi] As the margin (the
feminine is found also in LiciniuS,
Macer, Rabirius, and Vitruvius) at
