Afficit ille animos tantaque libidine ·vulgi ' 8 5
Auditurx sed, quum fregit -subsell'ia versu, ’
Esurit‚ intactam Paridi nisi vendat A'gaven,
Ille et militiae multis largitur honorem,
Semestri vatum digitos circumligat' auro.
Quod non dant procereS‚ dabit histrio: tu Camerinos 90
Et BareaS, tu nobilium magna atria curas Ρ
Praefectos Pelopea facit, ‘Philomela tribunos, ·
Haud tamen invideas vati, quem· pulpita pascunt.
Quis tibi Maecenas Ρ, quis nunc erit aut Proculeius
Aut Fabius? quis Cotta iterum? quis Lentulus alter? 9 5
Tunc par ingenio pretium3 tunc utile multis
Pallere et vin-um toto nescire Decembri.
Vester porro labor fecundior, historiarum
Scriptores ? petit hic plus temporis -atque olei plus:

Namque oblita modi millesima pagina surgit

Omnibus et multa crescit damnosa papyro·

Sic ingens rerum numerus jubet atque operum lex.
Quae tamen inde seges Ρ terrae quis fructus apertae Ρ
Quis dabit historice, quantum daret acta legenti?
