42, 43] These lines are the answer
to the question, “quis te manet exi-

The last thing to go is the ring,
which proves he has been a gentle-

man, and would have helped him to
beg with a grace.

44 acervant] “Untimely;” a
metaphor from unripe fruit. A
spendthrist need not be afraid of
dying before his time3 he has to
sear old age more than death.
