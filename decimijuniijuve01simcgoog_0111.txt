Dic igitur, quid causidicis civilia praestent
Officia, et magno comites in fasce libelli Ρ
Ipsi magna sonant, sed tunc, quum creditor audit,

1 14 russati] The rivalry between

any rivali-y between the old colours
red and white, or between the old
'and new. Caligula and Nero fa

cf. xi. 196,‘ ‘eventum viridis quo
