D. JUN11 JUVENALIS

SATIRA v111.

STEMMATA quid faciunt? quid prodest, Pontice, longo
Sanguine censeri, picto'sque ostendere vultus

Majorum et stantes in curribus Aemilian03,

Et Curios jam· dimidios, humerosque minorem

Corvinum, et Galbam auriculis nasoque carentem? 5
Quis fructuS, generis tabula jactare capaci

Corvinum, posthac multa contingere virga

1 Stemmata] The Romans had
two ways of proclaiming their de·
scent z one was to have painted
waxen masks of the sace and bust
in niches in the ‘atrium’ To this
1——5 mainly allude3 so picto&
vultus, mutilated Curii, and Corvi-
nus with the shoulders gone,
triumphal statues of the younger
Africanusz the other, to have a great
chart, with enwreathed medallions
connected by lines, on which the
titles of the portraits were written.
6—8 allude to this3 hence Her·
mann cannot be allowed to omit 5, 6,
to make way for 7. The represen-
tative of an old family which had
maintained its state would have both
the ‘images’ and the chart, the

have just had Corvinus before.'
Many MSS. omit it, perhaps by
the authority of Juvenal’s literary
executors, but it is not like a gloss-3
and capaci is n'o objection‚ as a
pedigree, which went so far·back,
would have to be wide enough to
include many collater-al lines of
descent; and posthac multa con·
tingere virga is very nearly equivalent
in sense to multa contingendas virga.
It is translated, “to have affinity
through many ancestorS, who bare
the fascaess’ So the Scholiast, and
Forcellini. Ruperti: ‘⁶ To have
affinity through many a branch of
the genealogical tree.'’ So Pers.
iii. 28: “Stemmate quod Tusco
ramum millesime ducis,'’ which is
a neat, and not a violent guess.
