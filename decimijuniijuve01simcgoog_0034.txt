that he attacked little which was really valuable‚ or as his
missortune that his time presented nothing valuable ,to be
attacked ; it is certain that no satirist had fewer such attacks to
answer for. Lucian and Voltaire did their best to propagate
what serious thinkers of every school might combine to stig-
matise as infidelity. Aristophanes contributed directly to the
condemnation of Socrates ς in the latter part of his career his
protest ‚against sophistical refinements subsided into an excuse
for sels-complacent brutality‚ Moliere devoted one of his best
comedies to the sanctity of passing conventionalities; another
to the ,indelibility of social distinctions3 another to the utter
ineptitude of female culture. Juvenal to be sure does object
to a woman having an opinion on the comparative merits os
Homer and Virgil, but he obj ects not because her opinion
is certain to be ridiculouS, but because she is certain to annoy
her husband with it. And he is more consistent as well as more
moderate than Moliere: he pines for the good old times before
the importation of hexameters: he regrets the obsolete life of the
Sabine farmer, when the men of the family worked all day in 'the
fields, and came home to a huge bowl of porridge, while the
women kept their hands coarse and their hearts clean by spin-
ning3 and every body was convineed, without quite knowing
what purple waS, that it was something wicked and outlandish.
It is curious that the universal empire of Rome should
have failed so completely to produce anything like a cosmopo-
litan culture. As long as Rome remained the capital both the
emperors and the aristocracy continued to oscillate between
a provincial affectation of native simplicity and a childish osten-
tation of foreign graces. Nero’s passion for personal display
had carried him far beyond Greek precedent, and such prece-
dents as he had dated from the days when Greek civilisation
was still shut up within the narrow limits of civic life, which
might excuse a man for showing off his accomplishments to
his neighbourS, before Philip had reproached Alexander sor
playing the lyre too well for a king. Even after that time
young men of good position still acted in the Atellan faroes
