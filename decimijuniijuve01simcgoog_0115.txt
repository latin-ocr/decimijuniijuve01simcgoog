SATIRA V11. ’

Fusa venena silent, malus ingratusque marituS,

Et quae jam veteres sanant mortaria caecos,

170

Ergo sibi dabit ipse rudem, si nostra movebunt
Consilia, et vitae diversum iter ingredietur,
Ad pugnam qui rhetorica descendit ab umbra, v

Summula ne pereat, qua· vilis tessera venit,
Frumenti: quippe haec merces lautissima Tenta,

175

Chrysogonus quanti doceat, vel Pollio quanti
Lautorum puerOS, artem scindens Theodori.
Balnea sexcentis et pluris porticuS‚ in qua
Gestetur dominuS, quoties pluit. Anne serenum

Exspectet spargatque luto jumenta recenti?

Hic potius: namque hic mundae nitet ungula mulae.

citing than because they were ac-
tually common, as Tacitus (Dial.
32) mentions vitiatarum electiones
as one of the unreal and useless sub·
jects which were harped ori sor ever
in the schools. ,

169 rusa venena] Where a sus-
pected poisoner is challenged to
drink, and manages to spill the
p01son.

malus ingratusque mantus]
‘⁶ Torta a tyranno uxor numquid
de tyrannicidio sciret perseveravit
negare, postea maritus ejus tyran-
num occidit: illam sterilitatis nomi·
ne dimisit intra quinquennium non
parientem. Agit illa ingrati.'' (Sen.
ii. Contr. 13). This excludes Medea,
who might otherwise explain all
three subjects.

170] One would think of Medea
here, but Grangaeus guesses plau·
sibly that a son is disinherited on
his stepmother’s accusation that he
is preparing poison instead of eye·
salve for his blind father.

174 <lua vnis tesam vemt] At
which some citizen would sell his
monthly ticket to the foreign, though

ibly naturalized, rhetor. The
lig? was limited, and the praetor

filled up vacancies. Augustus wanted

to have three distributions, instead ·

of twelve, a year3 but precedent
was too strong for him.

177 seinans] So the MSS.
Though he knows no rhetoric, and
tears the art of Theodorus to tatters ς
as we say, ‘⁶ Makes a mess of‘his
Lindley Murray.” Jahn scindes,
which is much easier and better,
and might be adopted if it had any
MS. authority; but unless we sup·
pose that all our MSS. are derived
ultimately from a single archetype,
it is difficult to see how scindes with
a blot over the e could have been
universally taken for scindes, i. q.
scindens. The sense of the future
will be “you will tear your text-
books of rhetoric to pieces.’' If the
sense of scindo were better estab-
lished, it would be tempting to
translate ‘’you will‚' or ‘Chryso-
gonus does, according as we have
the verb or participle, ‘ make fun
of‚’ ‘cut up,' ⁸ Theodorus and his
art of rhetoric.'

178 sexcentis] Nearly goool.

180] “Is he to wait sor fine
weather, and splash his cattle with
fresh mud when it comes?”
