pretension of Horace to be throughout a polished plagiarist.
The habit of persona] lampoons seems to have been common
to both Greeks and Romans It is possible, that in the
original comic chorus, which resumed its native freedom in
the parabasiS, individuals had the opportunity of distinguishing
themselves by telling impromptus 3 while it is certain that the
Romans retained to a late period the capacity of joining ex·

. tempore in a metrical expression of humorous contempt. But

among the Greeks, the clement of the choruS, which was

capable of musical and poetical ornament, was the one selected · .

for cultivation3 the time came when the moody and unsocial
Roman, in the solitude which succeeded the festival, worked
up all that he had said, and all that he had wished to say,
and all that he meant to say, when another festival gave
new occasion· for license‚ till at last the result had outgrown
such informa] opportunities of publication, and the satirist
had to recite his lucubrations to a select audience, and
confide the manuscript to a circle which at first was pro-
bably still narrower.

But even if we still possessed all the lost works of EnniuS,
LuciliuS, and Varr0, it is possible that we should hardly feel
safe in forming a very definite theory of the origin of Roman
satire. It would be difficult to be positive about the beginnings
of our own literature, unless we were able to ascend above
Chaucer and Gower. We are on firmet ground when we
endeavour to trace the development of Roman satire between
Horace and his two successorS. It is a proof of the growing
unreality, the mechanical sequacity of post-Augustan poetry,
that both Persius and Juvenal follow Horace in affecting alarm
at the consequences of their own freedom. The secluded life
of Persius makes the affectation peculiarly offensive in his case 3
but both he and Juvenal are equally faulty in forgetting that
Horace did not deprecate hostility till he had done something
to deserve it3 and reserved his hesitations and apologies for
the introduction of his Second Book, which shows signs os
serious precaution in the care with which the poet contrives
