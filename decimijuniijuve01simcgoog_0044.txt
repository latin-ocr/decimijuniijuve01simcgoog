discussion tends to become what it is in Aristotle, an. im·-
personal vehicle of thought, which is occasionally more con·
venient than direct exposition. But Juvenal’s favourite me·
thod is straightforward declalnation, which is kept down by
irony to the level of satire. One artifice · of his irony, which
distinguishes him from both his Roman predecessorS, is the

There are many lines in Juvenal which are or which may,
