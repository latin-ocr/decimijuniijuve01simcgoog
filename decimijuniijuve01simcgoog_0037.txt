'with his own hands; at another,- recounting the deepest moral
'degradation as coolly as an election commissioner‚ who enjoys
the exposure of a corruption which he honestly intends to sup*
press, In the N inth Satire particularly the tone of bantering
irony is almost as disgusting as the subject3 the Sixth is lars
offensive, but the writer is obviously determined to extract the
maximum of amusement from the painful subject of marriage,
which he regards from the old Roman point of view as a neces·
sary evil or rather a disagreeable duty, which it is Quixotic to
undertake to perform for the public benefit, and childish to
assume with any hope of personal satisfaction. Accordingly he
proceeds with a little passion, a great deal of verve supported
Iby' a great deal of gusto, to catalogue all the grievances of
sshusbands‚ who are never secure against being taken to task
2for solecisms when alive, or against having their children mur-

-writers who put a witty denunciation of loose men into the
mouth of a loose woman.

Both Persius and Horace are really more eheerful as
well as more sincere. Their satire is not a protest against the
hasdships of life, it is not the organ of the grievances of a dis-
-contented class; the world would suit them well enough is it
could only become a little more reasonable for its own benefit,
not for theirS. Horace perhaps found its folly such good fun
that he had hardly charity enough to wish it wiser, an'd Persius
was too good a Stoic to be annoyed by the general unwisdom
except so far as it prese-nted a temptation to himself? So far as
they have a serious purpose (and Persius is very serious) they
preach where Juvenal denouneeS. It was impossible for them
,to stop short, like Juvenal, with a catalogue of vicious habits to
be abandoned, of virtuous practices to be renewed3 their con·
.eeption of virtue, without being precisely higher than his, was

·at any rate more inward and more free. They did little per-
:haps to raise the conception of character, but they succeeded
