SATIRA VIII.

77

Jncipit ipsorum contra te stare parentum
Nobilitas, claramque facem praeferre pudendiS.

Omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se

140

Crimen habet, quanto major qui peccat habetur.
Quo mihi, te solitum falsas signare tabellas

In templiS, quae fecit avuS, statuamque parentis
Ante triumphalem? qu0, si nocturnus adulter

Tempora Santonico velas adoperta cucullo ?

145

Praeter majorum cineres atque ossa volueri
Carpento rapitur pinguis LateranuS, et ipse, ,
Ipse rotam adstringit multo sufflamine Consul ς
Nocte quidem: sed luna videt, sed sidera testes

Intendunt oculos, F initum tempus honoris

150

Quum fuerit, clara Lateranus luce flagellum ’
διπηες et occursum nusquam trepidabit amici
Jam seniS, ac virga prior annuet, atque maniplos
Solvet, et infundet jumentis hordea lassis,

Interea dum lanatas robumque juvencum

had an ancestor who built temples
for you to seal forged wills in, aster
abstracting the true?'' Hor. Ep. 1.

ceditur uti? Cf. Ov. Am. 111. iv.
41, Quo tibi formosam si non nisi

the accusative comes to be practically
the same as the nominative3 it is the

subject os one verb generally imagi·

nary in the infinitive, which, with
its subject, depends on the third
person present indicative of another
imaginary .verb. Nor can we say
that the Romans understood either
the verb in the infinitive or the
verb in the indicative in the sense
that it was potentially present to
their thoughts as a known clement,
fixed though latent.

by Quintilian (i. 5, ἕ 15), used by
Verg. (G. i. 210), whereon Bavius

superest ut tritica dicat.”

155—157] “While in office he
goes through the archaic forms with
archaic victims (so robumque juven·
cum). Even then he swears by
his horsy goddeSS.’' Robum is from
the Scholiast. Three MSS. retain
traces of it: other readings are .
