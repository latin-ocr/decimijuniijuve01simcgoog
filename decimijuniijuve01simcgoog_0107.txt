Accipe nunc artes; ne quid tibi conferat iste,

Propter mille annos: et, si dulcedine famae

Succensus reciteS, maculosas commodat aedes3 40

Haec longe ferrata domus servire jubetur,

In qua sollicitas imitatur janua portas,

Scit dare libertos extrema in parte sedentes

Ordinis et magnas comitum disponere voces, ·

Nemo dabit regum, quanti subsellia constent · 45

Et quae conducto pendent anabathra tigillo, “

Quaeque reportandis posita est orchestra cathedris,

Nos tamen hoc agimus tenuesque in pulvere sulcos >

Ducimus et litus sterili versamus aratro.

Nam si discedas, laqueo tenet ambitiosi 50v

Consuetudo mali3 tenet insanabile multos

Scribendi cacoetheS‚ et aegro in corde senescit.

36 sqq.] ‘⁴ In order to reserve his
poems for his patron's ear, he ceases
to recite in the temples; but the
patron pays him· in kind (as Au-
gustus once paid an im rtunate
⁴ poetaster,' who reward him as
liberally as he could with a few
‘denarii,’ and got a hundred ‘ ses-
tertia ' by his generosity). Then he
tells you, if you really care about
fame [though he cannot get any-
body he tells you to appreciate him;
nobody does do justice to modern
Eoetsl, you can have his fly-blown
ouse to recite in. It is a house
barred up, ever so far off, must
serve you, with its doors shut up
as fast as the gates of a besieged

town. BesideS, he can give you his
freedmen, to give the cue at the
end of the rows, and post loud-
voiced retainers up and down the
room. None will give you enough
to hire the benches, or the raised
sats, with the framework to sup-
port them‚ or the easy chairs in the
front, that you will have to pay for
ca ing back.”

Ἡ muneque] P. seems to have
had ‘ tenuisque, which got altered
into ‘ tenuique? The meaning is
both that we take pains to draw our
furrow fine, and that it does not go
deep into the sand.

ambitiosi P. S.. ω, quod a cor-
rectore illatum est, postquam 51,
quem spurium judico, additus est.”
