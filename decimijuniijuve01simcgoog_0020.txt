before breakfast ’the next morning. There are temper-s to
which it is easier to put aside what has to be altered for weeks3

which grow into months. As tempers vary 'and our knowledge
“ of Juvenal’s is likely· to, remain imperfect, it is safest to re·-

member the busy idleness in which a Roman gentleman passed .

his life at the capital, and the lazy leisure of the country
h'olidayS, ’ which is indicated by Horace’s EpistleS, and the
Eleventh Satire of Juvenal, and to conclude that the main
business of Juvenal’s life was to live, and. that his satires were
- only occasional ebullitions of an indignation, not without in-
tervals and consolations. “ Facit indignatio versum” is his
own mott03 and indignation is not a permanent motive‘ for
exertion, since it is generally mixed with contempt3 'for there
cannot be a better excuse for indolence than scorn of·the only
activity in which it is possible to take part. Our own Gifford
was often invoked to lash the vices and follies of the age, but-
sensibly -concluded that it was not „worth while to be always
in hot water for the sake of an age which needed so much
lashing. , ’

The writings of a satirist may easily leave us in doubt as to
the events of his life: it is not certain that they will impress
us with the character of the writer, or even that they will be,
so far as they go, a trustworthy representation of his habitual
sels. We may reckon with more confidence upon finding
traces of his personal ideas which are often distinctive, even
when the character is commonplace3 we may be sure of getting
a tolerably complete view of the points at which life bore
hardly upon the class and the generation which the satirist
represents, .

It is hardly fanciful to trace in Juvenal the last protest of
the Marian democracy against the imperial system, as we trace
in Tacitus the protest of the 'expiring aristocracy of Sulla, rather
than of the effete oligarchy of Scaurus: like Sulla, Tacitus
desired that the Senate should be an open corporation rather
than a close one 3 like Sulla, he believed that the Senate ought
to be in a position to govern the Roman Empire3 unlikq Sulla,
