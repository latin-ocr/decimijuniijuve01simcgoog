11 madidam] From the aque-
duct, a branch over the aqua Martia,
which ran over the porta Capena.

12—2o] The order in the margin
is that of the MSS„ the order of
the text is Jahn's‚ and is a decided
improvement3 cf. xii. 32, sor another
instance of what looks like a ten-
dency to write passages for their
own sake, and to piece them to·
gether afterwards.

rector has erased a letter,¹ and
written ‘praestantius ς’ if ‘ raesen-

likely have been quoted by Servius,
to illustrate the passages in Virgil,
which suggested it to a solitary in-
terpolator, who was followed by an

very poor and live like GypsieS, they
carry a truss of hay for a shake-down
and a basket sor broken victuals.

20 meridient silva] The wood is
said to do what its tenants do, cf.
‘⁴ crepitat Concordia” i. 116.

23 here] “In here neque E
plane neque I auditur ” (Quint. i. 4,
ἓ 8). “Here, nunc E litera termi-

netic spelling (Suet. Oct. 88).
