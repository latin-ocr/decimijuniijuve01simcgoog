xxxiv ’ INTRODUCTION.

somewhat prosaic duties relieved at rare intervals by somewhat
dull festivity. Yet Plautus succeeds in being thoroughly genias:
he laughs without a touch of Juvenal’s ferocity at the follies, of
the world: at bottom he reguds enioyment as synonymous
with profligacy, but though his standard of profligacy is hardly
reasonable he regards profligacy with tolerance as a folly not as
a crime. Even in Juvenal the relish for innocent plasmet
was not wholly extinct 3 we can trace its remains in the oesual
wish that the fountain of Egeria had been left in its primaeval
simplicity, in the invitation to Persius to come to an early
dinner at twelve and hear Homer and virgil—a form , of dissi·
pation, in Juvenal’s judgment‚ too exciting to be indulged in
osten. Perhaps the clearest trace of all is the pretty and sympa-
thetic description of the slave-boy who does not like being

. taken a'way from his kids to wait at table. Still it may be

said that the honest ma‚n„·who is· the ideal of most satirists4
is seldom so unattractive 'as he appears in Juvenal. Hss.
auster-ity <indeed is so impracticable as to betray him into
unreality..·' If in order to be virtuous it is necessary to be dull
with the dulness of three centuries ag0, it becomes necessaryq‘
in order to make existence endurable, that excesses should be
permitted, not to say encouraged, in the young. For instance,
in the Eighth Satire, where the tone is intended to be losty,
after the indictment against Lateranus is complete, an advocate
is introduced to plead in extenuation, that everybody does'the
same when young 3. whereto Juvenal only ventures to reply,
that Lateranus is old enough to know better. In the Eleventh
Satire, where the tone is intended to be genial, he says it is
quite proper for young men to take their mistresses to the
circus in their finery, and talk lond, and bet .high; for himself
he prefers to sun himself in a corner where he can get rid of his
toga. His ideal was hardly one to inspire the sustained enthu-
siasm or the tranquil assurance which would have guaranteed
the consistency of his moral tone. As it is we find him at one
moment lashing himself into a tempest of indignation that a

nobleman should actually put the drag on 'hi‘s own ‚carriage
