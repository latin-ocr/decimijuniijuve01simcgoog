“ Privatis majora focis: genialis agatur

Iste dies: propera stomachum laxare saginae,

60, 61] Time Vestals of Alba are
mentioned in* Orelli’s inscriptions,
1393, 2240, and in the letters of Sym·
machus, a contemporary of St Am-
brose. It is not improbable that
Rome took the sacred fire from Alba,
which, of course, would explain the
reason why the Rom'ans lest the
temples when they destroyed the
town; Livy (i. 29) attributes this for-
bearance to prodigies.

68 servatum] As the fish is so
large, heis presumably very old.

69, 70 ‘⁶ What could be more
bareface Ρ and yet he was elated.'‘
1t would be tempting to make the
fisherman's speech go down to aper-
tius, so that the sense would be,
‘⁸ He wished to be caught ; what can
be clearer?” But it was not clear to

the fish3 he set up his spines to
keep their hands off, and would
have floundered away if he could.
This would suit Erectas in terga
sudes (inf. 128), but what follows
here seems to tell the other way3
and ille ought to refer to Domitian,
like ille (inf. 73).

73 proceres] Distinguished by
Mayor from ‘patres’ (v. 64), as
favourites from senators; if they are
senatorS, they are called in for that
reason only, having been compelled
to dance attendance before. “

75 amicitiae] Domitian made a
point of being intimate with those
he feared or hated3 it was the best
