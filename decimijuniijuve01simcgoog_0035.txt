at Rome. It is hardly probable that actors were deprived
of their civil rights till the time of the Punic warS. The
severity of Roman manners did not reach its highest point
until the new aristocracy had become sufficiently powerful to‘
impose its family traditions upon public opinion. Possibly is·
Juvenal had gone far enough back in his search for the good
old times he would have escaped from much of his Puritanism.
But it is an extenuation of his narrowness that the incapacity
for understanding that accomplishments from driving upwards
could be practised with simplicity and decorum, for grace or

' for pleasure, not for parade, was not only his defect but the

defect of all Roman society. But though the conditions of
the society in which he lives may condemn a writer to choose
between two unsatisfactory standardS, it does not ,follow that

the clearness of his personal insight. All fervour on such sub-

his ‘ silly habit of writing verses.’ In Spain the nobles took a
pride in their dexterity in bull-fights, and a Roman noble-
required at least as much skill to succeed as a bestiarius. We
should be shocked ourselves if a member of our aristocracy
were to sing in public except for a charity; but¹ we should see
no objection to his rowing in a public race, or belonging to a
four-in-hand club, while to an American, the field-sportS, on
which we pride ourselveS, appear as barbarous as boxing.
Fervour on these subjects has other disadvantages beside
the certainty of becoming grotesque when it comes before an
audience of another period and another raee. It, effectually
excludes geniality. Plautus shares the fundamental concep-
tion of Juvenal, that life ought to be in the main a round of
