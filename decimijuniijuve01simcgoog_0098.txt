46 n. JUNII· JUVENALIS

Flos Asiae ante ipsum, pretio majore paratuS, “
Quam fuit et· Tulli census *pugnacis et· Anci,
Et, ne te teneam, Romanorum omnia regum

Frivola.
Respice, quum sities,

Quod quum ita sit, tu Gaetulum · Ganymedem
Nescit tot millibus emtus 60

Pauperibus miscere puer.- sed forma, sed aetas
Digna supercilio, -Quando ad te pervenit ille? . ’
Quando vocatus adest calidae gelidaeque minister ?
Quippe indignatur veteri parere clienti, ·
Quodque aliquid poscas et quod se stante recumbas, 65
Maxima quaeque domus servis est plena superbis·
Ecce, alius quanto porreidt murmure panem
Vix fractum, solidae jam mugga—&usta farinae,

Quae genuinum agitent, non admittentia morsqu
Sed tener et niveus mollique siligine factus 70

hide his accompliceS. Or perhaps
the meaning is, that you would take
him for a bogy stealing from be-

*hind a tomb if you caught sight of

him before you saw his master’s
equipage ε this view gives more
point to cursor and to monumenta ,-
the only meaning for clivosae would
be that the uneven ground makes
the darkness more eerie, ’ which
seems forced, though possible.

56 ante ipsum] The Romans lay
on sosas, to judge from bas· reliess,
higher than the tables‚ and certainly
too. high sor the attendants to be
able to hand things over the shoulder,
as is done at a modern dinner; be-
sides, it would be almost impossible
for a guest lying on his elbow to
take things so handed from be-
hind.

586] Cf. Hor. od. lv. vii. Q14, 15·
“Nos ubi decidimus, {Q uo pius
AEneas, quo dives Tullus et Ancus.’'

62 mgna supereum] Lit. ‘-de ·

serve the privilege of disdainl Give
him a right to be insolent.
63 candae suumque] To suit

the warmth to the taste of the host
and the more favoured guests.

65 quod— poscas, διο. ] The verbs
give lzis two reasons for indtjgnatur.
Juvenal’ s would have been in the
indicative. Cf. xv. 60 n. Mayor
seems to think that poscas and re-
cumbas are ‹zo-ordinate to parere.
If so, there is a sort of zeugma,
“He is too indignant to attend to
you, and indignant that you are a
guest, with a claim on attention,”
which is neither necessary nor im·
possible.

67 allus] Another ” of these
proud slaves. Why not the black
runner? because bread was handed
round once sor all and every guest
is always calling for wine, all through
the dinner?

68 solidae] Proves that va frac-
tum means “ ‘coar-sely ground’' not
btookhar rd to cut and hard enough to

rea

69 Quae genumum agitent]

“Stuff to work your cheek-teeth.'
It does not appear clear whether
they are wise-teeth or grinderS.
