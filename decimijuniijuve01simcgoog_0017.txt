survived its cause( Some old ‘copyists seem to 'have 'seii

the 'gloss natus, which has replaced-&nimus in most MSS.⁴ It
remains‘ to· explain-:the allusion to> Lateranus, as of age to'
defend Nero, and the address to Rubellius Plautus or Blandus
In the first place, we· may observe that the general and shame-
less relaxation of manners suits better with the age of Nero
than with that of Domitian, the reviver of the censorship3 in
the second place, Lateranus must obviously be a contemporary
of N'ero; in the third place, it is exceedingly improbable that
the younger Blandus (if there ever was one) could be the -ehild‘
of an imperial mother; because if PlautuS, like his father, had
married into the imperial family, Tacitus would have' mentioned-⁸
it as an additional reason for. the jealousy of Nero ; and it is
not likely that Juvenal would have confounded Plautus with
his son. It would be less violent to suppose that Juvenal
wrote Plaute under Nero, having taken offence at the seclusion,
which Tacitus and his class admired, and afterwards, when

obsolete apostrophe, but forgot to change the circumstances·
when he altered the name. If this hypothesis seems com·
plicated, it mus't be remembered that all the MSS. have Blande
or Plance, while Plaute rests only on the high authority of
Lipsius3 that the hero of the second Dunciad, in addition to*
his own sins, has to endure much inappropriate invective due
to the peculiar dulness of the hero of the first3 and that what
was possible to Pope in an elaborate work, was not impossible
to Juvenal in a passing digression.

One piece of evidence still remains for notice,—the allusions
in Martial to - a Juvenal with whom he lived on terms of
affectionate familiarity at Rome, when he published his Seventh
Book (where the twenty-fourth epigram is addressed to Juvenal,
and the ninety-first alludes to him), and who was still pre-
sumably at Rome as a restless suitor for preferment in the
beginning of Trajan's reign, while Martial, having given up
the struggle, was enjoying the, repose of his. native Bilbilis·
