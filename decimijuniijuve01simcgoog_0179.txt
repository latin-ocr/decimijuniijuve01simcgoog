Depositum Ρ stupet haec, qui jam post terga reliquit
Sexaginta annos Fonteio Consule natus ?

An nihil in melius tot rerum proficit usu Ρ

Magna quidem sacris quae dat praecepta libellis

Victrix fortunae sapientia: ducimus autem zo
Hos quoque feliceS, qui ferre incommoda vitae,

N ec jactare jugum, vita didicere magistra.

Quae tam festa dies, ut cesset prodere furem,

Perfidiam, fraudes atque omni ex crimine lucrum
Quaesitum, et partos gladio vel pyxide nummos? 25
Rari quippe boni: numero vix sunt totidem, quot
Thebarum portae vel divitis ostia Nili. .

different as possible about comfort,
or, to put it in another way, that it is
foolish to idealise rights or interests
and unworthy not to idealise duties.
At the same time this is only a
practical answer3 to a speculative
observet· the world is just as incura-
bly bad because it fails to produce a
faultless happiness, as human nature
because it fails to shew a faultless
virtue.

17 Fonteio commo] One Fonteius
was consul ΑΛ). 12, another ΑΛ). 59,
a third A. D. 67. See Introduction.

18 proflat usu] Most MSS. have
proficis, all usu ,· the Scholiast and
P. have prefici& usus is a possible
inference from the Scholiast. The
*Stoics oddly distinguished ‘profi-
cientes’ among the universal mass
of madness. l‘he teachers did not
claim to have attained wisdom (or
their lives would have condemned
them), but only to be approaching it
(or their profession would have been
useless), while they were obliged
to call the world mad, as preachers
now call it wicked‚ lest they should
trive the world a dispensation from
hearing thern. ⁸

not sapientia. Of course the com-
pliment to theoretical stoicism is
rather ambiguous “No doubt it is

with its ills.”

22 jactare nuum] Does not
mean to try to get rid os the yoke‚
but to toss about under it. Tr. “to

25 pyxide] sc. veneni, as liquid
poisons were practically unknown.

26 numero vix sunt] So P. and
most others; three MSS. have
‘⁴ numerus vix est.” One of the two
must be a correction. As to the
number, the Scholiast thinks of the
Seven Sages.

28 Nona utu] Nunc, the read-
ing of P„ involves a real and clumsy
hendiadys; nona would mean that
we are all but at the end of the
magnus annus of ten ages, in a
period whose depravity cannot be
measured by any metal in the Greek
scale. One Paris MS. of the tenth
century has non alias, a very pretty
conjecture, “We are living at
