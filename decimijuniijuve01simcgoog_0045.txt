INTRODUCTION. xliii

¹ densed and fastidious author like Persius 3 in a writer so
vigorous and yet so prolix as Juvenal, it is possible to defend
most of them as at worst pardonable redundancies‚ it would
be easy to defend all of them as belonging to alternative

drasts of the passages in which they occur, between which
” the writer never decided.

Most of them make perfectly good sense where they stand,
and are supported by all the ancient authorities.. Others are
omitted by several MSS„ and one or two interrupt the con-
nexion wherever they can be placed. The first fact proves at
most that they displeased ancient critics as well as modern ς
the second would be decisive if there were not reason to
believe that Juvenal never ..finished the revision of his Satires·

The introductory satire is naturally polished with most care,
and there only one critic has been found to suspect one 'line
(v. 157), which is so difficult that his suspicion is likely to be

ι more popular than it deserveS.

In the Third Satire Jahn condemns v. 104 ¹, against the
MSS. and John of Salisbury 3 Heinrich and Pinzger condemn
v. 113 as an unnecessary explanation3 for the same reason, if
the MSS. were few or worthleSS, vv. 49, 50, might be elimi-
nated3 Heinecke condemns v. 281.

In the Fourth Satire nobody condemns any thing..

In the Fifth, Heinrich rejects the end of v. 9, and the
beginning of v, 10, and the ¹whole of v. 66. Pinzger had
anticipated his dislike of v. 51 3 but the latter critic defends
v. 91, though omitted by Pithou's MS. and condemned by
Weber, Heinrich, Jahn‚--who also condemns v, 140, Ι suppose
for reasons of taste which would justify Heinecke’s rejection of
vv. 146—148.

In the Seventh, Jahn, Pinzger, and Heinrich condemn
v. 15, which contains an unusual quantity 3 Jahn alters v. 50

to suit his rejection of v. 51 3 Heinrich· condemns vv. 138 and
181 ς Valla condemned vv. 240, 241.

¹ Whenever nothing is said to the contrary, the MSS. are unanimous in
favour of the verse attached.
