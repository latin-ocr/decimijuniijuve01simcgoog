SATIRA VIII. - . 8'1

Nequidquam· effudit, nudum ad spectacula vultum

Erigit et tota fugit agnoscendus arena.
'Credamus tunicae, de faucibus aurea quum se
Porrigat et longo jactetur spira galera

Ergo ignominiam graviorem pertulit omni

Vulnere cum Graccho jussus pugnare sequutor.

Libera si dentur populo suffragia, quis tarn

Cujus supplicio non debuit una parari
Simia, nec serpens unm, nec culeus unus?¹

217 medin. inter poeula] The
Homeric, not the Aesch lean story.
The former has the advantage of
suiting the death of Claudius, which
it might be imagined Nero had. to
avenge on Agrippina, but for the
differences in favour of Orestes
which Juvenal proceeds to point
out; he did not kill Electra or
Hermione, as Nero did Octavia and
Antonia, his sisterS, and Octavia
and Poppaea, his wives.

221] Verginius directed that his
epitaph should run—-

“ Hic situs est Rufus pulso qui
Vindice quondam
Imperium asseruit non sibi sed
patriae.”

Ten years after his death it was still
neglected.
